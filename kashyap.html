            <h2>Nikhil and Prof.Roy</h2>
            <p>Nikhil, an aspiring writer, kept his head down while the bosses were yelling and scolding him for the delay he had been making. Nikhil had written a couple of stories for the publication  and was given a job of writing one more. He knew that if he'd finish the story in a hurry, just to please his superiors, he’d never forgive himself for turning the most promising idea that ever took a hold of his mind into just another commercial bread and butter.</p>
            <p>Nikhil was a young handsome man with only one ambition. To be under the section of “More about the Author” of the most influential and admired novel ever written in the century. He never had any real bond with a human. They were some beings that let him survive in their world. The only warmth and bind that he ever found was with characters. Characters of the books he read, the movies he watched and the stories he experienced. They were the ones who he wanted to live in the world of. He was sure that his living was to be made by creating some characters of his own and stitching them in a story. So he pursued his education in literature. This was merely an obstacle to be crossed so that he could handover a piece of paper to the owners of the bread he was going to consume. The food that he’d eat and survive to write the best piece of literature the world had ever read.He walked out of the room after assuring his bosses of his submission after a month. This is the time he knew after which the bosses would forget about this day and extend his deadline further. His bosses, though still mad at him, let him go.</p>
            <p>Madhur was making out with his girlfriend, Sheena, in his room when he decided to surprise her with a bunch of papers. Only the students of Prof.Nikhil Roy knew what value those papers possessed. It was the incomplete draft of the book that the Great Nikhil Roy once started writing but never finished for some reason the lovely humans around him would never know. Madhur took the bunch out of his sack and surprised Sheena. In complete surprise she asked him the reason for his possession of the pages. Madhur replied with a calm voice and a smile of pride, “Well, looks like sir found the one and only Mishti.” She opened the bunch and started reading.</p>

            <p>What intrigued many literature students like Madhur and Sheena was the fact that the writer of the best Novels of modern India could not finish the story he started almost three decades ago.</p>
            <p>Prof. Nikhil Roy was one of the most renowned writers in India, teaching in the National Institute of Literary arts. He was the one who inspired almost all the popular writers of the early 21st century. Though he didn’t care much about humans around him, his students, the curious and overwhelmed minds, sitting on the benches of his class, were the ones he had a soft corner for. Prof.Roy never entertained any greetings from his students outside the four walls of his class but never failed to answer the doubts and participate and originate the detailed debates that took place in his class.</p>
            <p>Now grown old, Prof.Roy wore a jacket and a hat. There was not even a single person alive in the world who had ever seen him without them. There was no one around him who had seen his arms and hair. Not that anyone was interested either. All the souls around him wanted to dig up his mind and unravel the world he lives in.</p>
