            <h2>Nikhil and Prof.Roy</h2>
            <p>
                Nikhil, an  aspiring writer, kept his head down while the bosses were
                yelling and scolding  him for the delay he had been making. Nikhil had
                written a couple of stories  for the publication  and was given a job  of
                writing one more. He knew that if he'd finish the story in a hurry, just to
                please his superiors, he’d never forgive himself for turning the most
                promising  idea that ever took a hold of his mind into just another
                commercial bread and  butter. <br/>
                Nikhil was a young handsome  man with only one ambition. To be under the
                section of “More about the Author”  of the most influential and admired
                novel ever written in the century. He never  had any real bond with a human.
                They were some beings that let him survive in  their world. The only warmth
                and bind that he ever found was with characters.  Characters of the books he
                read, the movies he watched and the stories he  experienced. They were the
                ones who he wanted to live in the world of. He was  sure that his living was
                to be made by creating some characters of his own and  stitching them in a
                story. So he pursued his education in literature. This was  merely an
                obstacle to be crossed so that he could handover a piece of paper to  the
                owners of the bread he was going to consume. The food that he’d eat and
                survive to write the best piece of literature the world had ever read.He
                walked  out of the room after assuring his bosses of his submission after a
                month. This  is the time he knew after which the bosses would forget about
                this day and  extend his deadline further. His bosses, though still mad at
                him, let him go.
            </p>
            <p>
                Madhur was  making out with his girlfriend, Sheena, in his room when he
                decided to surprise  her with a bunch of papers. Only the students of
                Prof.Nikhil Roy knew what  value those papers possessed. It was the
                incomplete draft of the book that the  Great Nikhil Roy once started writing
                but never finished for some reason the  lovely humans around him would never
                know. Madhur took the bunch out of his  sack and surprised Sheena. In
                complete surprise she asked him the reason for  his possession of the pages.
                Madhur replied with a calm voice and a smile of  pride, “Well, looks like
                sir found the one and only Mishti.” She opened the  bunch and started
                reading.
            </p>
            <p>
                What intrigued  many literature students like Madhur and Sheena was the fact
                that the writer of  the best Novels of modern India could not finish the
                story he started almost  three decades ago.
            </p>
            <p>
                Prof. Nikhil Roy  was one of the most renowned writers in India, teaching in
                the National  Institute of Literary arts. He was the one who inspired almost
                all the popular  writers of the early 21st century. Though he didn’t care
                much about humans  around him, his students, the curious and overwhelmed
                minds, sitting on the  benches of his class, were the ones he had a soft
                corner for. Prof.Roy never  entertained any greetings from his students
                outside the four walls of his class  but never failed to answer the doubts
                and participate and originate the  detailed debates that took place in his
                class.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now grown old,  Prof.Roy wore a jacket and a hat. There was not even a
                single person alive in  the world who had ever seen him without them. There
                was no one around him who  had seen his arms and hair. Not that anyone was
                interested either. All the  souls around him wanted to dig up his mind and
                unravel the world he lives in.
            </p>
            <h2>Kashyap</h2>
            <p>
                Nikhil sat at  his table, read the pages he wrote the day before and threw
                them away with  complete disgust. He picked up a fresh sheet of paper and
                started his story all  over again. There was no sign of boredom or regret
                hurling his previous draft.  This was not the first time he threw away 100
                pages filled with a million words  that didn’t please him. In fact the major
                share of his income was spent on  buying paper rather than bills and food.
            </p>
            <p>
                Writing his mind  down on the pages made him lose the sense of time. The
                story that he was sure  would revolutionise world literature. His pencil was
                no lesser than god when it  created the character that helped him think,
                wonder, explore the humans that roamed  around him. Not because he wanted to
                but because he had to include them so that  the mediocres would understand
                the mind of Nikhil Roy. He wrote down a  detective, the protagonist of the
                story that he kept moulding and baking over  and over again, stringer and
                finer every time. He lead down the character and  named him Detective
                Kashyap.
            </p>
            <p>
                Detective  Kashyap was lying on his wooden sofa reading the fresh news,
                which surprisingly  had a new ‘Poems’ section, when someone knocked on his
                door. He got up, kept  his newspaper on the sofa and put a shirt on. He went
                to answer the door,  buttoning his shirt on his way. He opened the door and
                a young lady with a  small notebook was standing in front of him. He thanked
                himself for buttoning  his shirt up and the girl asked, “Are you
                Mr.Kashyap?”
            </p>
            <p>
                Instantly he replied in a rude  way,”Detective…… Kashyap.”
            </p>
            <p>
                The girl apologised for her greeting and  was welcomed by Kashyap inside the
                house. He sat on his sofa and made her help  herself with the chair. He
                asked her name to which she replied, “Mishti”.
            </p>
            <p>
                She was a post  teen girl with golden brown hair which extended below her
                shoulders but above  her waist. She wore a pinkish-purple hairband, plastic
                and a white and green  salwar-kameez with a dupatta complimenting the green
                patterns on her kameez.  With a bag that hangs on only one shoulder, not a
                purse.
            </p>
            <p>
                With some  conversation starters they had a chat and then Kashyap asked the
                important  question, “Why are you here kid?” She wasn't a very young girl
                but Kashyap  asked this to establish his authority in this duo. Mishti with
                a nervous voice  said, “I’ve heard you never fail to catch the criminal of a
                case handed over to  you. Is that true detective?” Kashyap with a smirk on
                his face replied, “Yes it  is, but only if I am the first and only one to be
                incharge of the case. Have  you informed the police before me?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Of course not!” Mishti said, “ I am well  aware of your terms. Also the
                college wants to keep silent on this case, you  know, to keep up the
                reputation.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Good!” Kashyap smiled, “What’s the case  then?”
            </p>
            <p>
                Mishti replied, “ The professor of our  college has been missing for over a
                week. He has never taken a leave in 30  years of his career and now the
                sudden disappearance is suspicious to us. Not  many people in college are
                allowed to talk about it because the admission of  the new batch is starting
                very soon.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Kashyap bobbed his head once and asked, “  So he’s a physics teacher?”
            </p>
            <p>
                Shocked, Mishti asked, “How did you know  that?”
            </p>
            <p>
                Detective with a mischievous smile said,  “No one cares about the chemistry
                folks.”
            </p>
            <h2>Debates Explore The Truth</h2>
            <p>
                Prof. Nikhil  walked into the classroom and sat on his chair. All the
                students were having a  group discussion. Strangely, that day no one
                actually noticed his presence in  the class. He was a bit confused about
                this behaviour of his students and  decided not to disturb their silly
                little chats and kept listening to them  quietly. Shortly he noticed that it
                was not a silly little chat, there was an  actual debate, more like a quiet
                war, going on in his class. He tried to  understand what the two parties
                were fighting for or if there were just two  parties involved. All that he
                could see was Madhur speaking out his thoughts  and moving his hands and
                even fingers in every direction possible. Prof. was  quite impressed with
                Madhur’s ability to express himself to the world.
            </p>
            <p>
                Madhur reminded  him about Ms.Bagel Baker who was the sweetest lady
                Professor had ever seen in  his struggling days. Once established as a
                writer, Nikhil was not able to  distinguish the friends and flatterers so he
                kept a distance from all of them.  Although he started forming a soft corner
                for Madhur, the reminder of writing  humans that won't backstab the
                protagonist.
            </p>
            <p>
                Professor could  not help himself but got involved in the debate going on.
                He got up from his  chair and the shrill noise of the wooden leg sliding on
                the floor echoed in the  classroom, overshadowing all the chattering that
                once filled the room. The  students looked at the sound and saw Prof.Roy
                walking towards them. The class  went silent. Everyone had the same thought
                in their brain, “For how long has he  been listening to us, waiting for his
                class to start? Is he mad at us?” Madhur  on the other hand was just curious
                about the Professor's views. He was the only  one who didn’t have a scared
                face but an excited one. Professor noticed this  difference and directly
                walked up to Madhur and asked him politely, “What’s the  topic of
                discussion, kid?”
            </p>
            <p>
                The classroom thought of it as a rhetorical  question, one that the teachers
                usually ask before dismissing the student for  the day. Madhur, however,
                decided to explain the situation as he knew the  Professor’s love for
                debates. He said, “Sir, I and Sheena here - pointing at  her with an open
                palm - were discussing whether books should be adapted in  movies or not. I
                think it is a good way of storytelling as we discover how  other minds
                interpret the stories that we read and Sheena says that it makes  people not
                read the book and just watch the movies because it takes less time.  ”
                Professor thought about how to frame his views so that the students would
                understand. Before explaining his mind, he inquired about the sides that the
                other students have taken. Sheena informed him about the allies formed.
                Professor was about to start speaking his mind out but decided not to. He
                wanted to understand the thoughts of his fellow students, especially Madhur
                and  Sheena who were the pioneers of this debate. He knew well that the
                respect that  the students hold for him won’t let them explore the arguments
                against his  words. He said, “I want to understand what you folks are
                cooking in your  brains. You may continue your argument.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Some students  were happy that today’s class was officially dismissed and
                some were excited to  impress the Professor with their knowledge and skills.
                Professor leaned on the  bench that was in Sheena’s territory. What the
                students assumed was that  Professor Nikhil agreed with Sheena’s thoughts
                but the truth was that he wanted  to observe Madhur.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now being  conscious about their words the debate started.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Well, I discovered some of my most  favourite authors after watching a
                movie and then finding out about the book it  is based on. Movies made me
                read Stephen King.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “And did you like the movie better than the  book?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “No! But it was the movie who made me read  the book.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Not everyone has got the time to read the  book Madhur, people just watch
                the movie and carry on with their life. They’d  never know what the books
                are capable of.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “The people who are too busy to read books  won’t read it even if there is a
                movie based on one. Are you listening to  yourself bae— Sheena?”
            </p>
            <p>
                Sheena, although  offended with that insult, smiles on the blunder Madhur
                was about to make. Both  of them, along with some other students look at the
                Professor to know if he  caught it. All the silence was close to become
                awkward when a student from  nowhere said,
            </p>
            <p>
                “Don’t you think movies are actually  killing people's habit of reading
                books?”
            </p>
            <p>
                Madhur, being relieved, said,”I don't think  the people who don’t want to
                read books will start reading if movies just go  off.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Is that so? What do you think will fulfil  the appetite for stories and
                entertainment?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Just because you, in fact all of us, are  bookworms doesn't make the whole
                world have their faces lodged into books. Some  people like them, others
                don’t think it is worth the time they put in reading.  Therefore, they use
                the help of movies and other forms.”
            </p>
            <p>
                All the  classroom was waiting for Sheena to say something when Prof.Roy
                realised,  before he entered the debate the class was an active member of
                the debate but  now Madhur and Sheena are arguing and the whole class is
                waiting for Prof.Roy’s  judgement. The silence spoke for itself and Prof.Roy
                understood that being  present in the group of his students was a reality
                check of his students. The  only reason that the students used to
                participate in the debates that he used  to conduct in the class was that
                they thought of it as an assignment to raise  their marks more than a way to
                share their minds. This realisation agitated his  mind and it was clearly
                visible on his face. The students were not sure why he  had the face that he
                had. Now, although being upset, he had to present his  thoughts as promised
                and dismiss the class as soon as he could so that he could  rethink and
                renew his ways of teaching. He said,”Sheena, your thoughts about  this topic
                are purely based on your perspective. What Madhur said here was true  to
                some extent. Think about it, I know you don’t like Colleen Hoover. No one
                can actually compel you to read her just because they think that she is a
                genius. In the same way, You cannot tell whether one way of storytelling is
                superior to another. The definition of subjectivity is that you are always
                wrong.” He turned towards Madhur and advised him to frame his sentences
                before  putting them up. He faced the other students trying to say something
                else to at  least one of them but failed to find another face that was
                actually interested  in gathering knowledge from him instead of marks. He
                started to walk out of the  room without even informing about the class
                being dismissed. “This won’t happen  anymore students.” He said in a low
                voice. Very few students were able to hear  that.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Madhur and  Sheena along with some of their friends guessed the reason for
                Prof.Roy’s  behaviour that day. Maybe he had an upset stomach, maybe he was
                disappointed  about the arguments that had been put up, had he ever left a
                classroom before  the bell? All these speculations were floating in the air
                when a classmate  spoke in a mocking way,”And by the way, Mister Madhur, can
                you keep your  lovey-dovey romance outside the class?” The class broke into
                a laughter and  Sheena smiled while looking at Madhur. He had a smile on his
                face but his mind  was still thinking about the actions of Prof.Roy. The
                speculations started  fading out in thin air and the class was filled with
                the casual chats of  classmates. Not for Madhur though, even though his hand
                was held by Sheena while  the class was talking his thoughts were replaying
                the debate over and over to  find a reason better than his sentence which
                caused Prof. Nikhil to walk out.

            <h2>Has The Master Gone Broke?</h2>
            <p>
                Prof.Roy sat on his table inside his cabin.  He had taken his hat off and
                his coat was hung around his chair. He had his  arms on the table supporting
                his shoulders and his body upright but slightly  leaned. He had nothing to
                do now, nothing to think about. All the beliefs he  had about his teaching
                seemed to have betrayed him. Not being able to write a  story after the
                incident that happened 28 years ago. Prof.Roy never dared to  write to his
                full potential. All the books that the world now calls masterpieces  and
                groundbreaking were just some words he wrote to earn a living, in a hope
                that one day he will complete the story and provide justice to Detective
                Kashyap. Teaching was the only activity which came close to fulfilling his
                need  of contributing his mind and skill to literature. Now, that hope was
                torn into  pieces and scattered around in the world he never liked living
                in. This feeling  of helplessness was not new to him. He had experienced
                this a while ago. On the  12th of January.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was a  saturday morning when Nikhil woke up from his bed and while
                brushing his teeth  thought about the relation Detective Kashyap and Mishti
                would share.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Will these two ever fight? Maybe having a  strictly professional
                relationship with Mishti is a good idea. Or should they  fall in love?-Ya
                like that’s a real thing! Maybe they should work together like  co-workers”
            </p>
            <p>
                Galgallgalggalglalgg….thuuhhhh!
            </p>
            <p>
                He splashed water on his face and went to  take a shower.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Is it even a good idea to keep Mishti  involved in the interrogation? The
                story is about Detective Kashyap anyways.  Why should Mishti be a part of
                it? Sherlock had Watson, But this is Kashyap we  are talking about. Sorry,
                Detective Kashyap we are talking about. He is  brilliant, he doesn’t need an
                assistant. Ouuhh the water is cold!”
            </p>
            <p>
                He turned on the geyser and suddenly  realised that it was a Saturday
                morning. The bakery would be closed the next  day. Better get his bread and
                bagels packed. Nikhil dressed up and the morning  smile on his face was
                prominent, as always.
            </p>
            <p>
                The bakery was a classic old shop on the  ground floor of a residence on the
                corner of the street. Wooden walls and a  wooden door. The walls supported
                the black tinted glass that had the name of  the bakery and some buns and
                doughnuts kept along the window to attract  customers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Nikhil walked towards the bakery and seeing  Ms.Bagel Baker he said,
            </p>
            <p>
                “How’s the day going Ms.Bagels?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Good Morning Nick! And don’t you call me  that.” She smiled.
            </p>
            <p>
                “You know I won't stop. So why waste your  energy on correcting me. Use it
                to pack me 6 bagels and 2 loaves of bread.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Ya! Alright genius!” Still smiling at  Nikhil, she packed up the bread and
                bagels.
            </p>
            <p>
                As she was  saying those words, Dhawal knocked the counter table and greeted
                Ms.bagels with  a smile and asked for a cup of coffee and a bun-maska.
                Dhawal was a stunning  man with a sharp nose and cunning face. He was the
                only person who could pull  off the look of mullet with a goatee below the
                lower lip.
            </p>
            <p>
                He said,“Aashvi darling, would you pack me  a doughnut along with the coffee
                and bun-maska please.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Sure, Dhawal. And hey…” She turned her  head towards Nikhil and smiled in a
                mocking way. She looked at Dhawal again and  her blonde short hair swung
                with her all the way dashing onto her lips when she  continued, “Aashvi!
                That’s something I didn’t hear today.” All three of them  smiled but only
                two of them were not faking it.
            </p>
            <p>
                She packed  Nikhil’s order and handed it over to him. He left the bakery
                after paying for  it and Dhawal sat on an empty table. Nikhil didn’t look
                back into the bakery  and went home. He sat down and started writing his
                story. For the first time he  didn’t read what he wrote the day before.
                Nikhil took off his shirt and got  comfortable to continue his story
                further. He had a pencil in his hand, pages  on the desk. Yet he was unable
                to let the tip touch the paper. His thoughts  didn’t let him.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Why is this  happening? I don’t care who she likes more. Why would I?
                Dhawal is just an  accountant, I don’t have to care about him either.
                Perhaps, he is a good friend  of mine. He was the one who made that greedy
                landlord lower his rent for me. I  am just overthinking it. Ohkay, wait a
                minute, I guess I’ve figured it out now.  Maybe it’s important for him. This
                would work. She should—”
            </p>
            <p>
                Ting-Tong! (Twice)
            </p>
            <p>
                The doorbell made Nikhil snap out of the  train of thoughts. He went to open
                the door after grabbing his shirt on the  way. He opened it. There he was, a
                fat man with a half bald head that shone in  the sun or any light source
                around him, Kumar Ji. He was the landlord. The  greedy and grumpy old uncle
                that exists in every union, every society, every  official or unofficial
                gathering and groups of people. The one uncle who always  has one eyebrow
                raised. The one whose laugh makes dead people move their arms  just to cover
                their ears.
            </p>
            <p>
                Kumar Ji was  standing at the door at 9 in the morning. He had a grump on
                his face and a kind  of frustration that never has an actual reason to show
                up. The moment Nikhil  looked at his face he knew what were the exact words
                that were going to come  out of his mouth. Nikhil hoped that the overgrown
                moustache would stop the  words coming out of that mouth someday. Well that
                never happened. As Nikhil  expected, Kumar Ji said,”Mr.Writer! The brilliant
                mind of the century! Would  you please take out some time from your busy
                schedule of crumbling up fresh  papers and throwing them in the dustbin?
                Actually some less important tasks  like paying me for the roof over your
                head are still pending.”
            </p>
            <p>
                While Nikhil was  thinking about a suitable excuse to delay the rent, he saw
                Dhawal walking up to  Kumar Ji, maybe his delicious breakfast filled him
                soon, he thought. Dhawal  stood beside Kumar Ji and while putting his hand
                inside his pocket he greeted  him. Dhawal took out his wallet and paid Kumar
                Ji the month’s rent. While  handing over the notes of 100 he turned towards
                Nikhil who was standing at the  door, still trying to make up an excuse. He
                found it unpleasant that making up  stories was what he did for a living and
                he could never think about one when  needed urgently. Dhawal, looking at him
                with a cunning smile, one that grows  only on one side of the face, a smirk
                , said, “Nothing for the roof? Has the  master gone broke Kumar Ji?”
            </p>
            <p>
                Kumar Ji laughed at his statement when  Dhawal continued, “ Let it be sir,
                this happens in this field of work. He’ll  pay you soon. Isn’t that right
                genius.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Yes sir, I will.” Nikhil replied in a  voice filled with shame.
            </p>
            <p>
                He closed the door and placed his forehead  on it.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Why does he always do this? Should I even  consider him as a friend? Well
                he did manage to buy me some days to pay the  rent. Bagels!”
            </p>
            <p>
                He sat on his table and just when he was  about to grab his pencil, some
                voices echoed in his mind.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Don’t you call me that! Alright Genius!  Aashvi! Has the master gone
                broke?”
            </p>
            <h2>Bagels</h2>
            <p>
                Nikhil and Bagels were good friends. She  was the only one Nikhil liked
                talking to. Bagels was unaware of this fact for a  long time. It was a
                chilling evening when Nikhil walked into the bakery. His  hands were shaking
                and his fingers went numb. The heater saved him from passing  out in the
                lovely black snow. Aashvi was cleaning the counter early because the  snow
                made it pretty clear that a sane human would not dare to step out of the
                house. The door opened and the sound of the bell near the door made her
                notice  his presence. He walked in wearing a black coat and crashed onto the
                nearest  chair he could find. The fall didn’t showcase his condition very
                well. It was  quite subtle for a person falling down after walking for a
                kilometre in deadly  snow. Aashvi had already waited for him several times
                but never as a human, he  was a customer, like everyone else. She didn’t
                grasp his state and asked for  his order like a normal waitress would. He
                asked for a hot coffee. She poured  the coffee and added milk into the cup.
                She asked if he wanted some sugar to  which Nikhil replied affirmatively.
                She prepared the coffee and while she was  walking towards the table she
                noticed that Nikhil was not acting like a person  in his senses. His head
                bobbed and hands crossed each other at the wrists. He  was about to fall
                down from the chair. She quickly placed the tray on the table  and grabbed
                him. The coat didn’t let Aashvi know how cold Nikhil was. She made  him sit
                upright and rubbed her hands vigorously against each other. Then she placed
                her palms on his cheeks. She didn’t believe what her hands sensed. The snow
                wasn’t the coldest thing around. She was trying to get him back to his
                senses.  After trying for some time she succeeded. He opened his eyes.
                Though his brain  was unable to process what his eyes were seeing, he was
                able to know that  someone was trying to wake him up. Aashvi held him
                straight and handed the cup  of hot coffee in his hands. The warm cup made
                his hands come back to life. She  guided the cup all the way over to his
                lips and his muscle memory carried on  with the job. A sip, two, three.
                Nikhil was able to process the environment he  was in. After drinking the
                coffee all the way to the few drops, which people  tend to ignore when
                drinking coffee normally, he thanked Aashvi. She smiled.
            </p>
            <p>
                This was the  first time Nikhil talked to the woman behind the apron. Still
                holding the cup  to absorb as much heat as he could. She asked him if he was
                alright and if he  would mind her getting back to cleaning the counter. He
                didn’t mind, he  informed her accordingly. While she walked back to the
                counter she started the  conversation.
            </p>
            <p>
                “So Mr. —”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Nikhil.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Ya! Nikhil, What the hell are you up to?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “What do you mean?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Walking in the very warm snow.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Same thing as you, working.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Your job requires you to walk in snow?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Not really, but it helps sometimes.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Do you sell drugs?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Ya! Arrest me!”
            </p>
            <p>
                She laughed. “No really, what do you do?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “I am a writer. Well I am trying.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “I see, one of those who think breaking  yourself apart would help you write
                better.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “You can say that.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “People like you are idiots.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Excuse me?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Sorry, I didn’t mean it. It’s just that,  don’t you think your mind will
                work the best if you are well rested?”
            </p>
            <p>
                Nikhil smiled. “I’ll meet you tomorrow.  Well rested. Talk to me then.
                You’ll realise what words my well rested mind  comes up with while talking
                to a human.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Ouuu! Humans and all. I’m telling you,  either you’ll reach the sky or be
                stashed into a pile of garbage. There’s no  middle ground for people like
                you.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Okay, Miss judgements.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Damn it! Sorry again. I’m not actually  hearing myself.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “It’s alright. Can I have a bagel? I am a  bit hungry.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Sorry! We’re out! Anything else?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Nevermind, I’ll meet you tomorrow. Hand it  to me then. Like everyday.”
            </p>
            <p>
                He  got up and walked out of the bakery. As the door banged, she suddenly
                got all  the glimpses of a man who wears a black coat and hat. Every morning
                he comes to  the bakery and asks for bagels and bread. She felt like she
                missed a very  important train. She smiled at herself and carried on with
                the cleaning.
            </p>
            <p>
                Nikhil  got in his bed and was shocked at himself. He was the best person he
                could be.  For those few minutes he was a confident, charming and extrovert.
                “Did it  actually happen? Or did I just imagine it?” He thought about it for
                a while and  then his brain shut down. “We’ll know about it tomorrow.”
            </p>
            <h2>One Of Those Teachers</h2>
            <p>
                “Alright Mishti. Let’s get into it. Who are  we talking about here?” Kashyap
                asked.
            </p>
            <p>
                Confused. Mishti replied, “What do you  mean?” <br/>

                “Ya I know that. I want to know what  Dibakar is like in the class.” Kashyap
                had his hands behind his head and his  chin was down, completely focused on
                Mishti.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Ohkay.” Mishti said, sitting upright on  the chair. Even though there was a
                backrest attached to the chair, Mishti chose  not to use it. “Dibakar sir is
                a very devoted teacher and an active member in  the research field too. He
                makes the students interested in what he is talking  about. All the other
                teachers use fear and strictness to keep the class  disciplined, but in the
                class of Dibakar sir, the students are too busy  learning. It is almost like
                we forget that we can do other things instead of  understanding what he is
                saying.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Hey! Mishti! I am not telling you to write  an essay on the topic ‘An Ideal
                teacher’ alright. This is what every good  teacher can do. What do you think
                makes him so different that his life is in  danger?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Life in danger! How did you get to that  conclusion?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Worst case scenario is the best to start  with, kid. Go on!”
            </p>
            <p>
                Terrified with the statements just made,  Mishti continues, “Alright. Not a
                thing to say casually but alright.” She was  not able to get the words out
                of her mouth, not even out of her brain. He back  started hunching down and
                her face started descending which made her look at  the ground instead of
                Detective Kashyap.
            </p>
            <p>
                Kashyap understood the situation and helped  her arrange her thoughts so
                that pre-investigation can be carried on. He  started asking her simpler
                questions one by one so that she could answer in a  better way and he would
                get the information he wanted.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Were any of the students not happy with  the grades or his teaching style?
                Also, are grades so important now for the  students that they can take such
                steps?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Well in a way yes. Recently the college  announced that the weightage of
                grades for interview opportunities and  placements has been increased from
                27% to 49%. I don’t know whether it holds  such importance that a student
                would kidnap the teacher.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “And what about the students Mishti?” When  the word ‘Mishti’ in The
                Detective Kashyap’s voice hit her ears, she became  alert and her back went
                straight again.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Some students say that Dibakar sir should  pay more respect to what’s
                written in the books. Usually he reads the name of  the topic and starts
                talking about it like we do with friends. Actually yes, my  friend Shweta
                doesn’t like him much. Everyday after his class she rants about  the
                teaching style and sometimes about her grades. How she deserves more every
                time.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Hmm. So can Shweta do this?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “No! Of course not. She is my best friend.  She won’t do this. And perhaps
                she is a coward. I’ve told her several times to  ask Dibakar sir about her
                issues in his class. God, she won't even accept that  she likes Farhan.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Better. Were there any professional  rivalries?’
            </p>
            <p>
                “Students are not actually allowed to have  personal conversations with the
                teachers. We can find the answer to this  question from the research
                department.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Wait a minute. We?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Ya! You and me.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “I will be the one investigating this case.  I just need to know what you
                know about it.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “No sir, I am sorry but that will not  happen. I will be with you all the
                time.” <br/>
                <br/>
            </p>
            <p>
                “I am the detective, kid.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “And I know Dibakar sir more than you do.  Maybe more than any student
                does.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Why? Were you his favourite?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “No, He was my favourite. So I am on board  alright. Non-negotiable!”
            </p>
            <p>
                Kashyap smiled and allowed her to  participate in the investigation with one
                condition that his decision would be  the final one. Suggestions and advice
                will be permitted but Kashyap would  decide the next step. Mishti agreed to
                these terms although both of them knew  that that won’t happen every time.
                She knew that her stubbornness would  eventually make Kashyap put his foot
                back when necessary. Kashyap was well  aware about the girly tantrums that
                he would surrender against sometimes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Further  discussion led to some students falling into the suspicion zone.
                These were  Kushagrah, Shaswat and, after hours of failed efforts by Mishti,
                Shweta. They  decided to investigate these three students to find some more
                leads. The  college faculty finding out about the investigation was never a
                problem. What  are they gonna do? Stop it? So Mishti and Kashyap went to the
                hostel where they  realised that Kashyap won’t be allowed in. Mishti then
                went in and Kashyap  waited for her to bring Shweta to the Chai Tapri not
                too far from the hostel.
            </p>
            <p>
                Walking  in the corridor Mishti was trying ways to act nonchalant, “Hey
                Shweta, how are  you today– How are you today?! Better send her an official
                email, you idiot. –  Yo! Shweta shall we go– Why didn’t you stop after Yo! –
                Why is this getting so  difficult to pull off? Just be yourself Mishti, you
                will be fine. Cannot be  yourself and fine at the same time Mishti. How
                about, Shweta I am so tired.  Let's have a cup of tea. Ya, I think it will
                work. I should work. Will it work?  Maybe i should just—”
            </p>
            <p>
                Shweta bumped into Mishti.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Hi Mish! Listen, I am so tired right now.  I've been doing the maths
                assessment Mr.StudyHard gave us and it has been  eating up my mind raw and
                fresh. Let’s get some tea quickly so that I can fake  being awake in the
                class.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Mishti, having a surprised and obviously  relieved smile on her face,
                grabbed her by the arm and they walked down the  stairs. Being well aware of
                it, Mishti rushed down the last few stairs. They  both walked towards the
                Tapri when Mishti saw Kashyap sipping tea from the  classic glass cup with
                no handle and with the top of the glass always wider  than it should be,
                with respect to the bottom. She says to Shweta, “Listen to  me and don’t
                freak out. You know right that Dibakar sir has gone missing for  the last
                10-11 days.” Still walking.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Umm, I guess. Isn’t he on leave or  something like that?’
            </p>
            <p>
                “No. he went missing. Don’t pretend you  don’t know about it and tell him
                everything you know and answer everything he  asks.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Who?”
            </p>
            <p>
                Kashyap stood up and his chest rose up to  Shweta’s face. The neck movement
                she had to do was quite prominent. She stepped  back and when she realised
                the gravity of the situation, she tried to walk out  of it. Kashyap
                signalled Mishti and she grabbed Shweta’s shoulder pulling her  back. She
                was sure that Shweta couldn’t do such stupid acts. She would die of  fear
                before doing it. But this threshold had to be overcome to let the rest of
                the solving proceed without Kashyap’s, Detective Kashyap’s ‘We should
                interrogate  her’ coming in the way.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Sit down, Kid.” Kashyap said in an  authoritative voice and kicked a stool
                so that Shweta could sit. Scared to  death, Shweta sat on the stool looking
                at Mishti, her eyes screamed at Mishti  which she decided to ignore. “You
                bitch! There is no way I will be talking to  you in the future.” said her
                eyes, almost in tears. Mishti looked away and saw  Detective Kashyap buy a
                cigarette from the keeper and light it with the oil  lamp near Lord
                Krishna's artefact. Mishti was shocked.
            </p>
            <p>
                He said, “Alright, let’s get into it  Shweta. Mishti here tells me you
                didn’t like Mr.Dibakar’s teaching methods. You  also know that you think you
                deserve better grades than what he usually gave  you. Is that true Shweta?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Yes, I guess. I may have said that to  Mishti once or twice.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Once or twice? Mishti told me you had a  daily rant about Dibakar sir being
                incompetent.”
            </p>
            <p>
                She looked at Mishti, turned around to face  Detective Kashyap. Shweta
                looked down at her feet, shaking due to the  skyrocketing nervousness. She
                closed her eyes for a while and thought about the  ongoing situation. Once
                she had it sorted out, she wiped her eyes with the back  of her palms and
                got into her senses.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Yes. I didn’t like Dibakar much. He was  the kind of teacher who chose his
                favourites and preferred them over the rest  of the class. Mishti,
                Kushagrah, Desai and that silly Gauri.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Kashyap looked at Mishti and asked, “Is  this Kushgrah guy the same one we
                talked about?”
            </p>
            <p>
                Mishti nodded her head and Kashyap  continued with the interrogation.
            </p>
            <p>
                He took a puff from the cigarette, a little  twitch appeared on his left
                eye. He stored the smoke in his buccal and blew it  somewhere near to
                Shweta’s face, not directly at it though. He managed to make  it look as if
                he didn’t intend to smoke her face. As she waved her hand to put  the smoke
                away from her, Detective Kashyap quickly asked his next question.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Was killing him worth it?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “I don’t think s– Wait are you accusing  me?”
            </p>
            <p>
                Kashyap smiled just for a fraction of a  second and said, “No, I don’t mean
                that.”
            </p>
            <p>
                He blew another cloud of smoke near her  which broke her patience. She got
                up and yelled at Mishti, “Bitch! Stay away  from me now. There is no world
                in which I would want to see your face.”
            </p>
            <p>
                She dashed out of the tapri and Mishti had  a tear running down her cheek
                after Shweta went away. Kashyap gave her a  tissue, threw the cigarette on
                the ground.
            </p>
            <p>
                “I didn’t know you smoked Detective.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “I don’t”
            </p>
            <p>
                He coughed his lungs out twice. Bent down  while doing it. He rubbed his
                chest with a fist as asked for a bottle of water.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Damn it! No matter how you try, some of it  always runs down the throat.”
            </p>
            <p>
                He drank some water and rubbed his red  eyes. They started walking towards
                the boys hostel and on the way Mishti asked,  “if you don’t smoke, then was
                this act for looking like a Sherlock or what?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Not for the show-off. When you were  getting Shweta down here a man passed
                you while smoking. Shweta’s face was in  disgust when he blew a cloud. He
                wasn’t even near you but the face she made  made it clear that she didn’t
                like the smell of smoke around her. The question  that I asked her needed a
                response without giving it a second thought. So I  smoked near her face
                which made her forget about the guard she had put up  against me.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Smart! Did it work?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Not as much as I assumed, but she is  definitely on the list.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Are you serious? I’ve told you she is my  best friend. Didn’t you see how
                freaked out she was even to meet you? She  doesn't even have the guts to
                face you. I made her meet you just to clear your  suspicion out.”
            </p>
            <p>
                ‘Well you failed kid. She is a suspect. I  don’t want any argument over
                this.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Mishti was irritated.
            </p>
            <p>
                “And why the hell did you light your  cigarette with the lamp? Another
                trick?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “There was no lighter nearby.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Of course there was. It’s a <em>tapri</em> for god’s sake!”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Why are you yelling! It’s just a flame!  Where does Kushagrah stay?”
            </p>
            <p>
                Mishti looked at him with complete disgust.  She wanted to scold him over
                this but they had already walked their way to his  hostel.
            </p>
            <p>
                “I assume you are not allowed in the hostel  Mishti.”
            </p>
            <p>
                She smiled at his statement. “Well we live  in a world where boys can’t
                enter our hostel and people have assumed that girls  won’t enter. So there’s
                no such rule.”
            </p>
            <p>
                She went in through the stairs and Kashyap  started smiling at her. He was
                not smiling at what she said. His smirk appeared  because he knew that
                Mishti was going to understand why girls don’t want to  enter boys' hostels.
                He was waiting for her to come down and see her face. He  waited down the
                stairs for her when she came down. One of her hands was holding  Kusharah’s
                wrist, who was trying to catch up with her speed, and the other was  on the
                side of her eye. After the first glance, she didn’t want to see anything
                else other than her way out and Kushagrah. She walked down the last step and
                pulled Kushagrah down in front of her. She hit him on her shoulder and
                exclaimed, “What is this place you guys live in? Rats have a better home
                dude!”  Kashyap bursted down in laughter and looked at her. “Ah! I was
                waiting!”
            </p>
            <p>
                He asked Kushgrah whether he knew the  reason he was called here. He denied.
            </p>
            <p>
                “How are your relations with him?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “I’m sorry, with whom?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Okay. You don’t know what’s going on. So I  am here along with Mishti to
                investigate the disappearance of Mr.Dibakar. And  now that we are on that
                topic, What’s his last name?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Chatterji.” Mishti replied, which was  followed by Kushagrah’s answer. He
                said,
            </p>
            <p>
                “Dibakar sir is a very good teacher. That  guy knows his stuff. He doesn't
                even open the books while teaching. And also,  he is in the research team.
                So his knowledge about–”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Ohkay got it. He is your  favourite.”Blowing some air out of his mouth,
                Detective Kashyap turned towards  Mishti and said, “We have got a problem
                kid. You can go–he said to Kushagrah– I  want to meet some students who
                don’t like him. Apparently, he had chosen his  favourites.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Mishti, fed up, asked him to follow her and  she made Kashyap meet some
                students that Detective Kashyap was in search of.  Some students talked
                against Dibakar sir, some of them didn’t really care  enough about him. Soon
                Kashyap realised Mishti had an image of Dibakar sir  which she assumed that
                every other student had too. Although a point to be  noted was that
                Mr.Dibakar did have a great amount of knowledge. Maybe he was  just not able
                to put it up for other students.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mishti and Detective came back home to  discuss the case and arrange their
                thoughts properly with no disturbance of the  outdoors.
            </p>
            <p>
                “I don’t think any of the students are  involved here.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Okay, so first of all, you need to keep an  eye on Shweta.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “AGAIN! Kashyap I am telling you–”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Haa? Can you repeat that please for me  Ms.‘Bestie’ Mishti?’
            </p>
            <p>
                She exhaled a huge amount of air out of her  nostrils before she said,
                “Detective….Kashyap. Don’t you dare mock me like  that.By the way, what’s
                your first name?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “How is that relevant kid? All that we need  is you keeping an eye on
                Shweta.” <br/>
                <br/>
            </p>
            <p>
                “She is innocent, Detective!”
            </p>
            <p>
                “You’re calling me a detective right? Then  hear yourself bestie and do what
                I say.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “God! Why are you fixating on that? I am  telling you this is just a waste
                of time. It’s not because she is my friend.  She is a coward!”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Do as I say kid. I don’t want any more  argument on this.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Alright! But I won’t do this again. Shweta  is the last student I will be
                spying on. Call me bestie one more time and I’ll  break your nose.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “We’ll get back to it later.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Kashyap was a bit surprised at Mishti’s  acceptance of his request. He would
                have agreed to letting Shweta off the  suspects’ list if Mishti would have
                protested against it for a while. Perhaps a  couple of times were enough for
                him. Mishti, who thought she was right enough  to make Kashyap agree to her
                terms, was a little confused on her quick  retrieval from the argument.
                Maybe deep down she was suspecting Shweta for this  disappearance.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Did I put my foot down this soon? Why?  Shweta must be on to something. I
                have known her for a year now. Is ‘Best  friend’ just a tag we gave each
                other? Kashyap is a good detective. He is  smart. Maybe I should trust him.
                He is confident and has never disrespected me.  Well he did do it right now,
                but arguments allow little insults to happen –  bestie. He is a good man.
                Bestie is not that bad. Shweta can be involved in  this but she needs
                another person to even think of executing such a courageous  step. Maybe
                it’s not even her own idea. Has someone lured her in?”
            </p>
            <p>
                Both smiled at each other. Kashyap had a  smile which people generally have
                when their next words would be, “We’ll  continue this tomorrow.” polite and
                simple. His smile did have a sprinkle of  triumph but that was not noticed
                by anyone in the room. On the other hand,  Mishti’s lips were confused. They
                were getting mixed signals from her brain  which was busy calculating the
                possibilities of her acceptance. Her lips opened  up a few millimetres just
                about so that a porting of her teeth was visible, no  wrinkles at the
                corners of the eye. Her smile turned into a nervous rictus and  just when
                things started to get awkward, Detective Kashyap said, “Okay Mishti,  you
                also have your studies to do, We’ll continue this tomorrow.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Mishti, in relief, picked up her bag and  both of them got up. Detective
                Kashyap had put out his hand forward, offering a  handshake. Mishti, still
                nervous, accepted the handshake and rushed her way out  of the house. She
                forgot to close the door on her way out. Kashyap was a bit  confused with
                this behaviour, but he decided to ignore it and closed it  himself.
            </p>
            <h2>The Tomorrow</h2>
            <p>
                The sun snuck into Nikhil’s room and slid  all the way to his eyes to wake
                him up. Nikhil was already in his senses but he  was waiting for a reason to
                open his eyes and get out of the bed. The day  before was unusual. The cold
                must have IV-ed inside of him. He was not himself  that night. Nikhil was
                scared to face Aashvi because he knew that the Nikhil  she talked to for the
                first time was not the one she will be talking to today.  The person who
                would be ordering the bagels and bread would be a struggling writer  with
                just some commercial ads written in his portfolio. Aashvi would be
                expecting a charming man with smooth words that would gradually take a hold
                of  her mind.
            </p>
            <p>
                Nikhil  prepared his mind for a huge look of confusion and disappointment.
                There was no  way he was going to ignore Aashvi for the rest of his life. He
                decided to pull  the band aid in a single quick painless go.
            </p>
            <p>
                Nikhil  entered the bakery and the smell of bread went straight into his
                brain. His  legs walked up to the counter. He asked for the same order.
                Aashvi wished him  good morning and all he could do was bob his head while
                keeping his eyes fixed  on the loaves of bread. He wanted to talk to her,
                but couldn't. Nikhil paid the  money, grabbed the bag and left the bakery.
                Aashvi was a bit confused but was  too busy to keep thinking about it. The
                next customer was waiting for his  order.
            </p>
            <p>
                The  day went by. Aashvi kept working in the bakery and Nikhil kept walking
                on  random roads. He never paid attention to the surroundings. Walking made
                him  think better was something he believed in. It was the third week of
                walking and  although his thoughts were refined, they weren’t writable.
                Aashvi had to face a  grumpy woman that day. Although Aashvi was used to
                such behaviour due to her  mother, such incidents were strong enough to ruin
                one’s day. The sun was about  to rest itself after a tiring day. The weather
                was clear and so was the glass  door through which Aashvi saw Nikhil walking
                towards his house. She had no  customers waiting for their order so she
                rushed towards the door and grabbed  his arm. Nikhil realised who was the
                person pulling him back. He was not ready  for it. Somehow he managed to
                stay calm. A smile grew on his face and Aashvi  returned one too.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Am I not an interesting person if it isn’t  snowing?” She asked with a
                smirk.
            </p>
            <p>
                “No! It’s not like that.” He took a deep  breath. “I was not myself that
                day, you talked to a random guy who knew how to  talk. I don’t know how that
                came up.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Stop underestimating yourself. I know this  is your plan so I'll give up
                all hopes of you being interesting and then you’ll  surprise me.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “I don’t know what you are talking about.  But if agreeing with this will
                make you stop talking about me, then yeah!  You’re right.”
            </p>
            <p>
                They  shared a laugh and she invited him to the bakery to have a chat. He
                agreed.  They were talking when she asked if he wanted something.
            </p>
            <p>
                “OMG! Did you lure me in so that I’ll buy  something from the bakery?” He
                asked sarcastically.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Aghh! You are annoying! It’ll be on the  house! Happy?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Very! Just a bagel.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Alright. Just a moment.”
            </p>
            <p>
                She returned with two bagels. The time flew  like wind and the sun slept
                peacefully. Aashvi noticed that the street lights  were starting to light
                up. She said,”It’s late Nikhil. I think we should wrap  up.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Ya sure. I have some work too. I’ll see  you tomorrow?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Sure! Bagels and Bread!”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Bagels is a good name for you, isn’t it?”
            </p>
            <p>
                ‘No! Why?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “It annoys you, so Bagels it is!”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Please leave!” She pointed at the door and  laughed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Nikhil laughed too and walked away. Bagels  started cleaning the counter and
                Nikhil took out a pen and paper. His mind had  some great thoughts after the
                talk.
            </p>
            <h2>Prof. Roy's Lecture</h2>
            <p>
                “Okay students.” Prof.Roy wrote the name  ‘William Shakespear’ on the board.
                A particular smile appeared on his face when  he said, “Today’s class is
                conducted to discuss and learn, and praise of  course, The Bard: William
                Shakepear.” This smile usually appeared on his face  when he told the
                students about the unfinished story he had once written. He  had announced
                it to many batches over the years that he would hand those drafts  to a
                student who he truly thinks would be able to complete it with the same
                passion  he once had about it. He used to say, “This story belongs to the
                Mishti of the  real world.” He had never revealed the plot, instances or
                even Detective  Kashyap to the world. All the world knew was the name
                Mishti, no one even knew  who Mishti really was.
            </p>
            <p>
                Prof.  Nikhil was rubbing his hands when he started speaking about
                Shakespear. The  students in the class were black and white. He had a peek
                in the class before  starting when he noticed the contrast in opinions on
                the faces of his students.  Madhur was on the ‘Shakespear is boring’ side of
                the class while Sheena was on  the side which said ‘He is the master’.
            </p>
            <p>
                “William  Shakespear, also known as The Bard of Avon. Is a very interesting
                piece of  humankind to study about. Well saying that he was a human is wrong
                if you ask  me but for the sake of studying him, we will. Can anyone tell me
                why his plays  are still relevant? Why are the stories he made immortal,
                made him immortal?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “I think sir, his ability to capture core  human emotions made his stories
                interesting.” Sheena said.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Very well said. Emotions.” Prof.Roy wrote  it on the boards and drew an
                arrow from Shakespear to Emotions. “Does anyone in  this class know what are
                the core human emotions? The ones which make us  humans.” The answers of
                students started showering in the class.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Love!”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Happiness”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Fear”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Surprise”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Sadness”
            </p>
            <p>
                The answers didn’t see an end. Prof. Nikhil  raised his hand to stop the
                yelling and asked about the person who said love. A  student stood up.
                Nikhil asked him, “Why do you think love is an actual  emotion?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Don’t you believe in love sir?”
            </p>
            <p>
                Nikhil looked at the ground for an instance  and then started speaking.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Define love.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “It’s an emotion that… Just a second sir.”  Nikhil had a smirk with sadness
                as he waited.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Love is an emotion that makes us feel  heavenly pleasures.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Okay so you are saying love is being high?  Because I Promise you kid, the
                pleasures are heavenly.” The class along with  Prof.Roy cracked up.’ <br/>
                <br/>
            </p>
            <p>
                “No sir, it's a complex emotion.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “That’s right kid. But it’s not an emotion.  Understand this. It’s a name
                given to a club of human needs that are fulfilled  by other beings. Or one
                being to be precise. It’s not an emotion. It's a tag.”
            </p>
            <p>
                The class went silent. Madhur had his back  straight up and his ears faced
                Prof.Roy.
            </p>

                “Confused? Thought so. The league of  writers consists of many brilliant
                minds. Some of these minds ran out of ideas  and inspiration to write about.
                A man’s depression, his lust, his ambition, his  addiction, his failure were
                not able to create the spark in the minds of these  writers. The readers got
                bored of reading about a king getting stabbed by his  best friend or reading
                about an artist who drowned in the sea of his art. It  was this era when the
                brilliant minds induced the idea of being obsessed about  other humans,
                instead of being obsessed about art, power and ambitions. All the  literates
                found a spark in this topic. They started writing their own versions  of
                obsessions. Readers found these stories fascinating. The reason for the
                fascination of the readers was that being ambitious about thrones,
                paintings,  wars, battlefields, kingdoms and all the larger than life
                pleasures was too  vague in the practical world. Obsession of another human
                felt much more  feasible. A person could carry on with his job and have the
                satisfaction of  having an obsession just like the characters he reads. That
                was when the minds  of the illiterates started diffusing fiction with
                reality and hampered it  forever. Literates, being aware of this blunder the
                illiterates made, expanded  their business to earn and get their share of
                fame.”

                Prof.Roy’s mind came back to the class and  the students started being
                visible to him. He remembered that the ones  listening to him were his
                students, not his past life. He realised that none of  these words by
                Prof.Roy could be heard by Nikhil. He concluded, “And that is  how my child,
                ‘Love’ was invented by writers, not an emotion but pure fiction.”
            </p>
            <p>
                The class went  silent for a few minutes due to the complete destruction of
                their beliefs done  by Prof.Roy right in front of their eyes. Sheena stood
                up and asked, “Sir, does  this mean we should stop writing and reading
                romance stories?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “No! We know it as a fact that love is  fiction, but for the sake of
                literature, the illiterates must stay in the  darkness of ignorance on this
                topic. It is a well told lie that has been  recited so many times that it is
                now on the verge of being the truth or perhaps  it is the truth. Let it be
                this way. Use this blunder for your own good. I  would be happy if my
                students just go with it but don’t start believing in it.  Let the readers
                do that.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “So,  where were we?” He continued. “Ya William Shakespear.” Madhur lost all
                his  interest as soon as he heard those words. Twice in the same lecture.
                The  lecture on William Shakespear was going well. Although the students
                were  interested in what he was talking about, they were yet to recover from
                the  truth bombs he dropped. They were confused. Madhur was so bored of the
                lecture  that he was the first one to realise that Prof.Roy had never talked
                about any  writer or any topic with such conviction. His teaching was
                renowned all over  the country and his lectures were tagged as ‘Thought
                provoking’ but today he  had talked about Love not for the sake of teaching.
                He had secretly opened up  in front of the world but managed to mould it in
                such a way that it subtly came  out as a lecture. Madhur was interested in
                having a proper conversation about  it. Even though he knew that was not
                possible anytime soon. He decided to give  it a try after the class was
                over. When Madhur was lost in his thoughts, his  absence was sensed by
                Prof.Roy. He stopped the lecture for a while and made  Madhur stand up on
                his seat. “Am I not teaching well, kid?” To which Madhur  replied, “Of
                course sir, you are. It’s just that I find Shakespear boring and
                overrated.” The class was amazed by the brave act. Prof.Roy had a smile on
                his  face. He had finally found a person, a student, a devotee who
                questioned God in  a temple.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Is it because the language is very  different for you?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “No sir, I never feel as amazed as people  say Shakespear’s writing makes
                you feel. The fact that he was the one who had  invented many words that we
                use today is truly amazing but it does not make him  literally a god. In my
                opinion many folks don’t actually understand what he has  written and praise
                him just to not look like an idiot.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “What you say is true to some extent  Madhur. But don’t you think his
                stories hold some very deep philosophical depth  to them?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “No sir, I certainly don’t. Julius Cesar is  a simple assassination, Romeo
                and Juliet is a story about teenagers goofing  around for 5 days and then
                dying. I can go on but you get the point, don't  you?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “I understand your thought process now. I  am guessing you read the plays on
                your own in silence. Am I right Madhur?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Yes sir.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Okay Madhur, Mr.Know-it-all, recite ‘To be  or not to be’ in the class
                please. Say it like you mean it. Imagine yourself to  be Hamlet. Your uncle
                just killed your dad and married your mother. Imagine it  to be happening
                and you can’t do anything about it.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Now? Sir?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Yes, go ahead please.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Nervous and conscious, Madhur said, “Sorry  sir….but… ummm… To be…”
            </p>
            <p>
                Prof. Nikhil started reciting the line.  Each and every word was pronounced
                as clear and sharp as a crystal. All the  pauses, the highs, the lows, each
                and every bit of the quote was said out loud  to such an extent that some of
                the other classes were able to hear it.
            </p>
            <p>
                “To be, or not to be—that is the question.
            </p>
            <p>
                Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
            </p>
            <p>
                The slings and arrows of outrageous  fortune,
            </p>
            <p>
                Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
            </p>
            <p>
                And by opposing end them? To die— to  sleep.”
            </p>
            <p>
                It felt like  Hamlet had somehow appeared in front of them. It felt like
                Prof.Roy was a  victim of treachery. The emotions that he once had held back
                had flown out  through his voice instead of flowing through his eyes. There
                was a long silence  in the class. Some students had tears rolling down, some
                of them were in shock.  Nikhil for a fraction of a second let his eyes water
                up but quickly managed to  drink it up. He looked at Madhur and said, “You
                get it Madhur? Shakespear isn’t  meant to be read in silence. it ‘s meant to
                be performed, heard, experienced.  Today’s assignment for you is to read all
                the plays out loud. Do it like you  mean it. It is possible that you will
                still not understand what depth it holds,  you haven’t experienced life
                enough. Sooner or later you will. When you’ll be  betrayed by your friend,
                uncle, perhaps wife. One day you’ll be ambitious about  life. It will be
                that day when you’ll understand Shakespear.You will kid. One  day you’ll
                fall in love with Shakespear.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Prof.Roy  walked out of the class even though the bell was yet to ring.
                Everyone knew it  was enough for today. The lecture was different. It was
                way personal to even  call it a lecture. Few students today were fortunate
                enough to see through the  hat and jacket of Prof.Roy. Madhur received a
                title today. Mr.Know-it-all.
            </p>
            <h2>12th January</h2>
            <p>
                Nikhil took a break from Detective Kashyap  and wrote some short stories for
                magazines and newspapers. Out of all the sins,  writing just to earn money
                was a chore Nikhil hated all his life. Of course he  didn’t think this
                through before completely submerging himself in the world of  literature.
                Not even a day goes by when he regrets not graduating from an  engineering
                college or a medical one. “Nah, medicine is boring” he thought and  resumed
                his regret of not graduating as an engineer. He managed to gather his rent
                from these writings and the cut in prices of bagels and bread Aashvi managed
                to  provide him. She was the only one who he knew would understand the
                situation.  For some days he kept his head down while collecting the bread
                and bagels.
            </p>
            <p>
                The  money was in his hands when he knocked on the door of Kumar Ji. Kumar
                Ji opened  the door and accepted the money with a taunt. When Nikhil was
                about to leave,  Kumar Ji invited him to a small party. When Nikhil asked
                the reason for the  party Kumar Ji had a wide and polite smile on his face,
                the one which screams  out ‘I am a proud father’. He told Nikhil that his
                daughter was the topper of  the school in 12th class. Well, once a meeting
                of all the parents was held when  they collectively decided that all the
                other classes were to be studied but not  celebrated and 10th was the class
                when only one or two students out of the  entire school of hundreds received
                a reward of studying for nearly a decade,  more than a decade. Nikhil
                gratefully accepted the invitation. He was not very  interested in attending
                the party before knowing that Bagels was coming too. He  had wished,
                dreamed, about dancing with her at least once in a lifetime and  this may
                become a good excuse. Kumar Ji had earned a hell lot of money from renting
                a bunch of shops, flats and from his main business of sweets. Everyone knew
                that it was going to be a grand party. A man with a golden tooth just
                because  he wanted one and no one else to spend the money on except his
                daughter. Who  will soon be going off to college. Kumar Ji’s love for
                dancing was also well  established in the neighbourhood. Everything added up
                well for Nikhil. He had  planned his lines a day before. He had chosen the
                song. He had planned on  wearing his best suit for the party. The best of
                Nikhil Roy was being prepared  for the 12th of January.
            </p>
            <p>
                It  was a chilling evening. Nikhil was dressing up and practising his lines.
                He  walked to the bakery and saw Bagels still working through the glass
                window,  wall. He was nervous and scared to some extent. “Is she not coming
                to the  party?” He entered the bakery and said, “Heyy Bagels, still working?
                The party  is going to start soon.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “I know Nick, but my stupid boss is invited  too and guess who has been
                handed over the work he had to do.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “That’s sad. You won’t be coming then?”
            </p>
            <p>
                <br/>
                “I hope I’ll clean the bakery soon. I’ll be a little late but I hope I can
                join  the party when it’s hot. Actually Dhawal has asked me to join him.
                There will  be dancing and talking. I am a bit nervous, Nick. He seems to be
                a nice guy.”
            </p>
            <p>
                A high vacuum was felt in Nikhil’s stomach  like somehow a black hole had
                been spinning inside him. Way faster than they  usually do. His peripheral
                vision started to blacken. He said, <br/>
                “Oh! I didn’t know you guys were dating.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “No we are not. He asked me yesterday if I  could join him. I am not sure if
                he wants to date me. But I am hoping he does.”
            </p>
            <p>
                She crossed her fingers and a blush  appeared on her cheeks when she said
                that. Heartbroken was a very superficial  word to describe Nikhil. The only
                thing that made sense in this world was  Bagels. She was the reason for the
                good characters in his stories. All the  moments he decided to create were
                broken down into pieces and each and every  tiny bit of the pieces was
                thrown far away from Nikhil’s reach. He wished her  all the best and turned
                around to walk out. He was at the door when he put his  hands in his pocket
                and found a 100 rupee note. Nikhil turned around and handed  the money to
                Aashvi and said, “For the cut of prices you gave me.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Nikhil  decided to attend the party anyway because this was the only way to
                make Kumar  Ji like him and extend the next date for the rent. He was
                talking to Kumar Ji  and congratulating his daughter when he saw Aashvi walk
                in. For a moment he  kept staring at her and then abruptly moved his eyes
                back on Kumar Ji. They  talked for a while about politics, Kumar Ji talked
                and Nikhil kept his ears  open but brain shut. His smile was assuring Kumar
                Ji and made him keep talking.  Soon a friend appeared laughing like everyone
                was partially deaf around them  and hugged Kumar ji. Both started laughing
                and greeting each other. The man  congratulated Ms.Kumar and Nikhil saw an
                opportunity to get away from Kumar Ji.  he had been good to him. Enough for
                next month’s favour.
            </p>
            <p>
                Nikhil  went away from Kumar Ji’s sight and sat on a chair behind Aashvi. He
                sat in a  place where he could see her clearly but she had no sight of him.
                He sat there  for a while and soon he noticed Aashvi’s leg was shaking. She
                was looking  around her as if she wanted something, someone. Soon Nikhil
                realised that she  was waiting for Dhawal to join her. Nikhil saw the broken
                pieces appear in  front of him. Not all of them but enough to make him try
                to ask her again. What  was the worst that would happen? He gathered the
                courage and got up. Set his  suit and ran his fingers through his hair to
                make sure they are tidy. He walked  up to her and politely asked her if he
                could sit beside her. Aashvi, still  nervous, looked around the hall and the
                entry gate once again before letting  him sit. “Dhawal didn’t show up?” He
                asked confidently.
            </p>
            <p>
                “No. I don’t know why he is so late. He  said he would pick me up but I
                waited for a long time for him.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Well I am sure he means no offence. If you  want I can fill the void.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Fill the void? C’mon Nikhil you can frame  better sentences. Try again. Nah
                it’s too late for it now. Just go with it”
            </p>
            <p>
                “What do you say?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “I guess if Dhawal is not coming, you are  the best person I know around
                here.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Really? Well then maybe you’d like to  dance with this next best person”
                Only if Nikhil had the guts to ask her that.  All that happened was they
                both sat there in silence, not the romantic one, he  was thinking of a line
                to grab her attention and she was just hoping that  Dhawal would show up.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Is this best person good enough to be  allowed to dance with you Bagels?”
                Still silent. The words were in his mind but  none of them managed to get
                past the barrier of his mouth.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Ohkay, here we go. Do it. Ask her to dance  with you. Oh wait, the money
                that was in your pocket was supposed to be given  to the DJ so that he will
                play the song you practised dancing on. Good move  returning it to Bagels in
                style you idiot! FoR ThE CuT Of PRicEs YoU GaVe Me,  Genius! Ohkay let it be
                now, dance on any song that will be playing.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Aashvi, would you like to dance with me?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “There! Wasn’t that though.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Bagels smiled and said, “Of course Nick,  but you know what, Bagels feels
                like it comes from the heart. So stick with  it.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Nikhil smiled with joy and said, “Sure  Ms.Bagels, shall we?” He held his
                hand out.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Ahh! Irritating. Feels like Nick to me.”
            </p>
            <p>
                As they both got up Aashvi decided to turn  around and look for Dhawal for
                one last time. So did Nikhil. There he was, just  entering the party when
                it’s almost over. Nikhil closed his eyes in  disappointment and Aashvi
                closed her eyes out of embarrassment. She turned  towards Nikhil, still
                holding his hand and with a ready apology she began,  “Hey! I am so sorry
                for this but–”
            </p>
            <p>
                “It’s alright. Go!”
            </p>
            <p>
                He left her hand and Aashvi was in complete  embarrassment. She apologised
                again and then walked out of Nikhil’s hopes. He  stood there for a moment.
                Looking at the ground. He decided to leave the party  and go home. Continue
                his story. His only purpose in life.
            </p>
            <p>
                While  he was walking home, he thought about adding some exciting moments .
            </p>
            <p>
                “What will make the reader flabbergasted?  What would make them sit straight
                up and read ahead? Why did she do this?  Dhawal is clearly not the best guy
                around her. I am. Yes you are. Why does she  even like him? He is a coward.
                The neighbourhood is well aware of it. Am I too  friendly? Should I? That’s
                right, She must. Maybe it’s too soon, Isn’t it?”
            </p>
            <p>
                Nikhil  walked back to the party. He had no idea why he was doing it. There
                was nothing  left to go back for. They will be dancing, she will be
                impressed. Kumar Ji can  spot him there. The rant about politicians can
                start again. There was no reason  to go back and a huge reason to go home.
                But Nikhil decided not to be the  wisest person that day. When he reached
                the party hall, there was no sign of  Aashvi and Dhawal. “I am not here for
                them.” He continued his walk. He saw that  the cake was about to be cut now.
                “That’s right. I was here for the cake  ceremony. Of course Kumar Ji would
                like me more if I was present.” He saw the  cake being cut, ate a piece and
                congratulated Ms.Kumar. He had a strong urge to  pee and found a small
                cavity in the wall beside the stage which said, “Men.” He  started walking
                towards it when....
            </p>
                <h2>Not Even To  His Favourite Student?</h2>
            <p>
                Nikhil, devastated because the pieces of  his hope were still somewhere
                visible to him even after Aashvi abandoned him  but what he saw later that
                evening made him throw those pieces away by himself.  He came back home and
                right away sat on his table. He started reading what he  had written
                earlier.
            </p>
            <p>
                Both of them  took some time to think about the case individually. Most of
                the thinking was  done by Detective Kashyap himself. Mishti was distracted
                for the majority of  the time. Couple of days later a girl from the college
                knocked on Mishti’s door  saying, “A guy, actually a man, is waiting for you
                downstairs.” Her voice was  obviously mischievous. Mishti paused for a few
                seconds and told her to go.  Couple of minutes later Mishti walked down the
                stairs to find out Detective  Kashyap was standing there, waiting for her.
                She asked him to follow her but  didn’t make any contact that could be seen
                by someone else. They walked out of  the girl’s hostel and sat in a more
                crowded place. Crowded enough so that they  won’t be suspicious but not so
                much that they won’t be able to have a  conversation. It striked Kashyap
                that she had been extra careful and conscious  that day. He ignored her
                behaviour and discussed the case with her. He told  Mishti that he had
                thought of a plan to collect some more hints of the case.  She was relieved
                that he didn’t ask what she was thinking because she wasn’t.  Detective
                Kashyap said, “Okay, here’s a plan. It is very risky, maybe it will  affect
                your college life. You may be suspended or expelled if we are caught.  Are
                you willing to take the risk?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “I’ll decide once you tell me the plan.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Wise! So we have to trespass Dibakar. Do  you know where he lives?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Yes I do. But wait, what! Trespass? Are  you crazy Kashyap?”
            </p>
            <p>
                She instantly realised that she forgot to  add Detective but to her
                surprise, he didn’t notice it. Maybe he didn’t mind.  “Are we getting
                closer? Shut up Mishti!”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Listen to me, You don’t have to join me.  Just give me the address and I
                will do the job.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “No! If you are going I am coming too. If  something goes wrong, you forced
                me here.”
            </p>
            <p>
                She smiled. Kashyap looked at her and they  both started laughing. She
                looked at him and paused.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Scared? Bestie?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Detective! I’ve told you not to do that.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Laughing, Kashyap said, “I am sorry. Your  plan would have worked but your
                friend, the one who called you knows that we  know each other.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “It’s manageable. Don’t worry about that.  When will we be in action
                detective?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Today at 11:59PM.”
            </p>
            <p>
                ‘Why not 12?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “I don’t know if it's today 12AM or  tomorrow 12AM.”
            </p>
            <p>
                She just kept looking at him and Kashyap  tried to look away. They both
                started laughing again.
            </p>
            <p>
                “11:59 it is then.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Mishti stood up and patted her skirt and  started walking away. When Kashyap
                got up she turned back, put her hair behind  her ear with her fingers and
                said, “See you soon.” Kashyap smiled and waved  bye-bye to her.
            </p>
            <p>
                It  was 11:40 in the night Kashyap was waiting for Mishti in the parking lot
                of  Dibakar’s building. She arrived exactly at 11:59. Kashyap was shocked by
                her  punctuality.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Were you hiding somewhere around and  jumped out at the exact minute?”
            </p>
            <p>
                Both laughed while Mishti tied her hair up  so that it wouldn't disturb her
                during the mission. She tied her hairband on  her wrist and wasted no time
                getting into the house through the window, balcony  actually but it was too
                small to be called one.The door was supposed to guard  them but it didn’t do
                a very good job. The latch came off after a few hard  pushes. It was not a
                very difficult job. Getting out was the tricky part.  Jumping from the first
                floor is not something engineering students are masters  of. They just build
                the floors, the machines needed to build the floors, the  stuff to put in
                those built floors. But they didn't make an easy way out in  emergencies
                like getting out of a crime scene as criminals.
            </p>
            <p>
                Both  of them got in the house and started going through the stuff kept in
                the living  room. Mishti had a torch with her and using her knowledge about
                Kashyap and  Detective Kashyap, she decided to pack an extra one. Her
                judgement was right.  He handed over the torch to Kashyap and received an
                appreciation for it. They  found many trophies and awards that Dibakar had
                received. There were more  certificates in the living room than photo
                frames. It was a typical achiever’s  living room. The one who likes to
                flaunt his achievements. Medals section,  certificate section, trophies
                section. Kept in such a way that each one was  clearly visible. Many awards
                were labelled the same. At least 8 of them  displayed ‘Highest Contributor
                to Science’ even the shapes were the same. It  was sure that Dibakar had
                won the same  competition consecutively in 8 years. He asked Mishti if she
                knew about them.  She replied affirmatively. She told him that those were
                the trophies from the  research section. He was the winner of the most
                prestigious award in the  Physics research section one can get. It came with
                a 2 week holiday, all  expenses plaid, for a single person. No student was
                allowed to know about those  events. But you know, every strong wall has a
                crack. She explained, whispered,  about the award to Kashyap. The suspicion
                of a professional rivalry grew in his  mind. They searched the living room
                pretty well. There weren’t many things  there that portrayed his personal
                life. Mishti was going through the television  and the stuff around it when
                her little toe got dashed into one of the legs on  the table. A short but
                evident scream escaped her mouth just before she closed  it tight with her
                hand.
            </p>
            <p>
                Kashyap managed to calm her down and  the moment things seemed well, the
                light of the bedroom switched on and panic  rose between the two. “Dibakar
                didn’t live alone?’ Kashyap exclaimed but  whispered. “I don’t know!” she
                replied. “Good Job! favourite student, perhaps  bestie!” Mishti wanted to
                bash his brains out with the aluminium torch she had  in her hand but it was
                too silent of an environment for others to hear Kashyap  scream in pain.
                They both hid behind the 4 seater couch because it was easier  to get to the
                balcony door from there. A short, healthy woman walked out of the  bedroom.
                She ran her eyes around the living room and found the balcony door  open.
                She closed it and the two brains just stayed still beside her feet hoping
                she would not accidentally hit them. Thankfully, she didn’t. She was going
                back  to the bedroom and the panic between Mishti and Kashyap had just
                started to go  down when an old woman started talking. The brains looked at
                each other and  blamed the other person without saying it out loud. “What’s
                the matter? Are you  okay?” The old lady asked.
            </p>
            <p>
                “I am fine ma, I thought I heard some noise  in the living room, the latch
                had fallen off again, it needs to be replaced.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “I’ll take care of it, you need to rest  now.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Rest? Rest ma? He has not shown any sign  of his presence since forever and
                you expect me to rest?”
            </p>
            <p>
                The old lady started crying when she hugged  the other lady, not so old.
                They stayed there for a while. Kashyap and Mishti  had their hearts racing.
                If the old lady opened her eyes, even the most faded  beam of light would
                reveal their presence there and obviously moving away was  not an option.
                Even a feather would make noise while drifting in air. It was a  silent
                night.
            </p>
            <p>
                They  both went into their bedrooms and the two detectives jumped off the
                balcony not  caring about their ankle bones and other bones at all. They ran
                away, far away  from the building. When their lungs said, “That’s it”, they
                stopped. Breathing  heavily, Mishti punched Kashyap on the shoulder and
                said, “You didn’t know he  had a wife? What was your research about then?
                His shoe size? Tell me if  Dibakar sir wears a big shoe, it will print a
                bigger mark on your face when I  smash it there.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “My research? So you're telling me that  Dibakar didn’t even mention his
                wife in his classes? Ever? Not even to his  favourite student? Bestie!!”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Ohh god I am going to kill you!”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Please do it, better than working with an  idiot who doesn't even know the
                marital status of her idol.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Shut up Kashyap! Don’t blame me for your  negligence.” — “Oh oo!”
            </p>
            <p>
                “My negligence? What do you expect me to do  ask the neighbours? Hello
                random person, I am also a random person asking about  the family of this
                teacher who recently went missing and I am not any  investigator or so I am
                just a random guy asking about this person for a  completely unrelated
                reason from his disappearance. Will that work genius?”
            </p>
            <p>
                Mishti was sure that Kashyap noticed it but  didn’t bother. He called her
                ‘bestie’. She didn’t want to let this argument  travel any further in time
                because she was not sure how many times Kashyap  would ignore her saying
                ‘Kashyap’. So she apologised. Kashyap was shocked at  her quick retrieval as
                he knew it was his job to know about his family. They  both walked in
                silence towards Kashyap’s home where the case was to be further  discussed.
            </p>
            <p>
                None  of them had the will to have a discussion about the case but they were
                too  scared to tell the other person that. Scared of what? No one knew. They
                had the  option to postpone the discussion but they didn’t. Kashyap opened
                the door and  asked Mishti to enter first, she did. He followed her and they
                sat on their  respective seats. Kashyap opened the first button of his shirt
                and exhaled his  lungs out to relax. Mishti let go off her hair but kept the
                hairband on her  wrist as it was. She leaned back on the chair and asked
                Kashyap, “So Detective,  any leads?”
            </p>
            <p>
                Kashyap was surprised that she didn’t put  her thoughts first as she used to
                do but was too tired to show it. He found  this question as an excuse to
                stop the conversation so that he could sleep for  a while. He said, “I am
                not in the state today Mishti, let’s discuss this  tomorrow. Can we?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “That’s alright.” Mishti said, relieved. <br/>
                “You want me to drop you home? It’s late.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Yes, can you please?”
            </p>
            <p>
                He nodded and both got up. Mishi let her  hair hang and wore her
                pinkish-purple hair band over it. They both left the  house. This walk held
                one of the most awkward silences in Mishti’s life. SHe  was not able to
                utter a single word because her brain was too tired processing  the right
                ones. Kashyap on the other hand was silent because his brain was not  even
                trying to make words to speak, he was just a skeletal walking with Mishti.
                He was not even aware that the situation contains no sound except the one of
                their shoes. They kept walking under the light of the streetlight. Some of
                them  kept flickering which added to the sleepy state of their minds under
                the blue night sky.

            <h2>Have You Ever Written One?</h2>
            <p>
                Prof.Roy entered the class. His jacket was  neat and his hat was tilted. As
                always he had his bottle with him in which he  used to fill up with tea, to
                the top. He sat down on his chair and fixed his  hat. That day the lecture
                was on the topic ‘Writing an antagonist.’ This topic  was one of those which
                excited the students and the professors but was very  difficult to teach. It
                either went very technical which killed the class or it  took an unnecessary
                philosophical turn which turned out to be useless. Professor  Roy was
                thinking how he could start the class. The strategy was confusing the  kids
                so that they will pay more attention to him and won’t ask as many doubts.
                Every professor did this for this particular topic. He was thinking about a
                way  to start the lecture when a student asked, “Sir, have you ever written
                a poem?”
            </p>
            <p>
                Every student was curious to know the  answer. At the same time they were
                surprised that they never noticed that they  never read a poem written by
                Prof. Roy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Prof.Roy thought  about it. This was the perfect opportunity. 2 purposes can
                be fulfilled at the  same time. Confusing the kids and….
            </p>
            <p>
                Prof.Roy stood up and said,
            </p>
            <p>
                “Addiction of your champagne defines love,
            </p>
            <p>
                My question asks domestic.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sight of your greens is acknowledged by the  world,
            </p>
            <p>
                My answer is your symbiotic.”
            </p>
            <p>
                The class went silent. They were not able  to digest that a man like
                Professor Nikhil Roy would write such nonsense. They  started finding deeper
                meaning to it. Tried deducing if there were any  metaphors. Is it about a
                woman? About books? About literature? Everyone was  confused. To ensure that
                he had succeeded, he asked, “Confused?”
            </p>
            <p>
                The whole class said yes. The purposes were  fulfilled. Both of them.
            </p>
            <p>
                He said, “Focus!” and started the lecture.
            </p>
            <h2>Professor  Barun</h2>
            <p>
                Nikhil was happy with what he had written  earlier. He didn’t have any urge
                to change anything from the last set. Maybe he  was in a hurry to…….. He
                started writing.
            </p>
            <p>
                The  next day Kashyap went to the girls’ hostel and asked Mishti to bring
                Shweta to  him. She was reluctant at first but gave up and called her down.
                He asked  Shweta to follow him but didn’t let Mishti join them. Her class
                was about to  start so she didn’t bother with his behaviour.
            </p>
            <p>
                Shweta  was aware that the situation was serious so she followed Detective
                Kashyap’s  command. They both sat at the Tapri after which Detective Kashyap
                started the  interrogation. Shweta was well aware that this is an
                interrogation and not just  a simple conversation.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Hey, Kid, now I know that you have some  sort of a rivalry with Dibakar.
                Tell me about it in detail.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “There’s nothing to tell, detective. He was  a teacher who refused to give
                me the grades I deserve.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “And that’s all? Mishti tells me you are a  coward. Will a coward plan the
                kidnapping of a teacher just a few weeks before  the annual exam? So that
                she won’t have to go through the Result Day?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “What!! Do you seriously think I will go  that far for some grades? I can
                score well enough to pass the exams and A  COWARD?!!?! Did Mishti really say
                that?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Who do you think should replace Dibakar if  he didn’t return?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “What do you mean didn’t return? Is he—”
            </p>
            <p>
                “No! We don’t know that.  Answer my question Shweta.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Okay, If you ask me, Replacing him is not  a huge task for anyone it seems.
                There are many teachers more qualified and  smart enough to make the
                lectures useful enough.” The smirk and the confidence  she had when she said
                that made Detective Kashyap suspicious about her.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Is his position higher paying than other  teachers?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Well not really, but his post in the  research section pays a hell lot of
                money.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “So can a teacher do this? Who do you think  can be the next person to
                acquire his position?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “I don’t know, detective. Those things are  not to be known to students.
                That too freshers.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Who do you think can give me the answers  to my questions, kid?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Maybe you should figure that out by  yourself.”
            </p>
            <p>
                She got up and started walking out of the  place without facing him again.
                She knew that the Detective had a chance of  stopping her if she turned and
                she couldn’t refuse. She kept walking and  Kashyap had no questions in his
                mind that he would have asked her if she would  have stayed. He watched her
                go, not really, he was lost in his thoughts and  planning further steps
                because of which he didn’t notice where his eyes were  looking. The
                chai-wala hit his tablespoon on the container which snapped  Kashyap out of
                his thoughts. As he was leaving, the chai-wala stopped him and  told him to
                ask for Professor Barun. Kashyap tried to gather more information  from him
                but he refused to utter a single word after that. Kashyap gave up and
                waited for Mishti at his home.
            </p>
            <p>
                Kashyap  was on his sofa completely relaxed with a book over his face. He
                was reading it  before he fell asleep. The thoughts about the case were
                still wandering in his  mind, teasing him about the face that there is no
                clue he can rely on, just  suspicion.
            </p>
            <p>
                Bang! Bang! Bang!
            </p>
            <p>
                Someone on the door, not entirely happy,  was banging it continuously.
                Kashyap wore his shirt and opened the door and as  he guessed, Mishti was
                standing there ready to storm into his house. She  stormed.
            </p>
            <p>
                “You told Shweta that I called her a  coward? You idiot!”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Manners, Mishti!”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Do hell with your manners! Bloody stupid,  idiot! How could you do that?!”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Mishti!” Kashyap yelled at the top of his  voice. The sound of his made her
                come to her senses.
            </p>
            <p>
                She closed her eyes, took deep breaths for  a while.
            </p>
            <p>
                “I am sorry Kash–”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Detective!”
            </p>
            <p>
                “I am sorry Detective Kashyap! I crossed  the limits. I truly am sorry.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Still disturbed, Detective Kashyap sat on  his sofa while Mishti stood on
                her spot. <br/>
                “Why are you here? Just to yell at me or to have a proper conversation?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “To have a conversation.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “That won’t happen if you talk like that  kid.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “I am sorry Detective!”
            </p>
            <p>
                “It’s alright. Don’t do it again. Ever.  What is the thing you wanted to
                tell me?”
            </p>
            <p>
                She started walking towards her chair when  Detective Kashyap stopped her.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Unnnnn…No No No! Stay where you are right  now and tell me.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Ou come one Detective! Are you seriously  going to do this?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Why-did-you-come-here-Mishti?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Okay, Never mind! I deserve this. First of  all don’t ever talk to Shweta
                again but I know that’s not going to happen  because of your unnecessary
                hate towards her. So at least keep me out of that  conversation. And second,
                I guess I know who else can be involved in the  disappearance.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Professor Barun?”
            </p>
            <p>
                Shocked, Mishti said, “Yes! How did you  know that?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “You tend to forget who I am, that’s the  reason you should add the right
                word, Detective, before saying Kashyap.  Apparently the professors have a
                gossip session once in a while at the Tapri. I  didn’t imagine that
                scientists also do this stuff but they are humans too  right! Now we just
                have to figure out the motive.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Hah! That’s good – Detective – Kashyap,  but here I surpassed you. I know
                the motive. Can I sit there? On my chair,  detective?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “No! Stand right where you are and tell  me.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Ahh too bad! I am either sitting on the  chair or walking out of your
                apartment.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Get out!”
            </p>
            <p>
                Mishti started walking out of Kashyap’s  house. She was slow and
                deliberately stomped her feet when she walked out to  signify what Kashyap
                was missing out on. She got out of the house, closed the  door and continued
                her walk. She was at the stairs when Kashyap opened the door  and called her
                name loudly. She smiled and turned. She made sure that her smirk  was
                clearly visible to Kashyap. Her walk was still slow which agonised Kashyap.
                She walked into the apartment and sat on her chair.
            </p>
            <p>
                “So detective, curious enough now?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Yeah, I guess one of us has to be mature  enough to handle the situation.
                How can I expect that from you, bestie?!”
            </p>
            <p>
                Mishti smiled, smirked, and said, “Ohkay  Detective be the mature one,
                apologise.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “You are overdoing it Mishti, drop it now.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Yeah you’re probably right. So about Barun  sir. Do you remember those
                certificates and awards that Dibakar sir received  for 8 years in a row?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Ya, I suspected that professional rivalry  can be one of the motives.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Exactly! Barun sir was the one who was the  runner up every single time!
                And guess when the next award distribution is  taking place. This Sunday!!”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Alright, So we have 6 days to solve the  case.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “What case? Barun sir is guilty. Let’s  report it.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “How can you be this biassed Mishti? Shweta  is not guilty because she is
                your friend. Barun is guilty because is a rival of  your favourite teacher!
                Is the partiality even strong enough to pierce through  your bias for
                Dibakar?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “No Detective! It’s not my bias! Barun sir  has a motive! A strong motive!”
            </p>
            <p>
                “And proof? You’re right, kid! Who needs  proof? We should just start
                hanging all the people who are responsible for  every crime that takes place
                in the world. At least one of them was guilty! —
            </p>
            <p>
                Nikhil  stopped writing. He found a way to explain the backstory of
                Detective Kashyap  but it was to be written later. He continued the story.
            </p>
            <p>
                —You know what?  Sometimes none of them are!” He took a long pause.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Alright! At least we can interrogate him.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “That is exactly what we are going to do!”
            </p>
            <p>
                They left the house and booked an  appointment with Mr. Barun. In his office
                Barun sat on his squeaky chair. A  half bald, old man wearing a grey suit
                stretched back on his huge black chair.  One of his teeth was plated. A
                silver cap that is usually put on after a cavity  treatment. He was fat,
                round enough to make it difficult for him to see his  shoes. His moustache
                covered his lip almost all the way down. He was eating his  favourite banana
                chips when Detective Kashyap and Mishti entered his office.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Good evening Mr.Barun. I am Detective  Kashyap.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Hello detective! I am Professor Barun  Kumar.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Yes I know about you sir, I also know how  busy you are with your classes
                and research work. So let’s get to the point.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Oh My God detective! You are not a small  talk person. Bring it on
                Detective, how can I help?”
            </p>
            <p>
                Mishti felt a bit left out in this  conversation but preferred to keep it
                that way. She didn’t want the professor  to get upset with her if Kashyap
                crossed the line. Barun sir may become her  next professor.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Are you aware of the disappearance of Mr.  Dibakar?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Yes, I am. Well I didn’t know he had gone  missing. But I surely noticed
                his absence. I thought he was on leave or  something like that.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Ohkay! Are you in any way involved in his  kidnapping?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Oh My God!!!” Mishti said, not out loud.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Excuse me Mister! Who do you think I am? A  criminal? Dibakar and I had our
                differences but it does not make me a criminal.  How can you accuse me of
                such a thing?!”
            </p>
            <p>
                “What differences sir? Can you tell me?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Certainly not! How the hell did you even  get in here? And you, Kid. Who
                are you? Do you study here? Let me know your  branch and I’ll make sure you
                go through hell for doing this business.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Mishti was terrified. Her words stuck in  her mouth.
            </p>
            <p>
                “That won’t be necessary sir, I will take  your leave. She has nothing to do
                with this. I used her to get to your office  so that this conversation could
                happen in private. Keep her out of this.  Whatever happened today will not
                be a part of gossip in the college anytime in  the future.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “You better bet your life on it, Detective  or whoever you actually are.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Both were   frightened from head to toe. Mishti was not able to hide it but
                Kashyap  managed to get both of them out of the situation. He was the one
                with the extra  flashlight that day,
            </p>
            <p>
                Both  of them ran out of the research section and sat in the canteen. Mishti
                was  about to cry when she said, “Kashyap! I don’t like that man. How can a
                person  be so arrogant! I’ve never met him before properly and don’t plan to
                meet him  ever again. Please find Dibakar sir, I can’t have this man as my
                professor.”  Kashyap understood her state of mind and didn’t correct her
                about his name. He  patted her back a few times and assured her that
                everything will be alright.  Mishti inhaled and filled her lungs up with
                some fresh air before speaking.
            </p>
            <p>
                “We are stuck detective! There’s no one to  interrogate.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Well, no one except one.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “What’s in your mind now?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “I was thinking of interrogating Dibakar’s  wife. Should we give it a shot?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “You know what, let’s do it. It’s better  than sitting here and doing
                nothing.
            </p>
            <p>
                Both got up and Mishti wiped off some tears  that she thought may have been
                running down her cheeks. As they were walking  out of the canteen Kashyap
                decided to lighten the mood. He found no better way  than saying, “Let’s go
                to Dibakar’s house, BESTIE!”
            </p>
            <p>
                Mishti made a fed up face but both of them  knew that she wasn’t upset about
                it this time.
            </p>
            <p>
                Kashyap  knocked on the door and Dibakar’s wife Shrishti Banerjee opened the
                door. She  was not familiar with any of the two faces she was seeing and
                neither was she  used to men wearing a brown jacket and a brown hat along
                with a darker brown  overcoat. Kashyap asked,
            </p>
            <p>
                “Good afternoon ma’am, I suppose you are  Mrs. Banerjee. Aren’t you?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Yes. Yes I am.” She replied with concern.
            </p>
            <p>
                “We have some questions regarding your  husband’s disappearance. Is this a
                good time?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Actually it isn’t but I don’t think there  will be any in near future.
                Please come in.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Kashyap entered the house and Mishti  followed him.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Thank you ma’am.” She said while going in.
            </p>
            <p>
                Kashyap and Mishti sat on the sofa that  they hid behind once. “Nice Couch
                Mrs. Banerjee” Mishti smiled within herself.  Mrs. Banerjee thanked him and
                asked her mother to get some tea for the guests.  Mishti told her that it
                won’t be necessary. Kashyap looked at her with puzzled  eyes. His eyes said,
                “But I want tea, kid!”
            </p>
            <p>
                Mishti ignored his casual behaviour and  asked Mrs.Banerjee to have a seat
                politely.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Ma’am can we start with the questions  please?” Kashyap asked.
            </p>
            <p>
                “No! Wait. We haven’t informed the police  yet. How did you find out about
                it?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “I am his student. He didn’t inform us  about any leave he would be on. His
                absence was suspicious to everyone but we  were informed not to discuss it
                with anyone outside the college for the  reputation.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Mrs.Banerjee was about to point out the  fact that Mishti didn’t answer the
                question properly and didn’t explain the  presence of Detective Kashyap in
                her house but he questioned her before she  could ask for any explanation.
            </p>
            <p>
                “You didn’t inform the police? Why? Did  Dibakar inform you before leaving?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “He did, but he told me that he should have  returned the day before
                yesterday. I decided to wait for a couple of days  before taking it to the
                authorities.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Has he done such stunts before?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Yes. Many times.His trips with his  trekking folks never end on the
                required day. It’s always a day or two after  that.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Has he gone trekking?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “He didn’t tell me. He just told me that he  will be gone for a week.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Mishti asked, “But ma’am there are no  holidays anytime soon in the college.
                I am sure Dibakar sir went on such treks  during the holidays. He has never
                skipped a class.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “That’s the reason for my worry, child. I  am hoping he will show up soon.
                That fellow doesn’t even carry his phone at  such times. ‘I want to connect
                with nature’ he says!”
            </p>
            <p>
                Kashyap asked, “Is anything bothering him?  In college, family, friends?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “I am not very informed about the college  things, but he once mentioned
                that he was not able to contribute enough in his  research group as he used
                to. He was quite disturbed.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “What was his behaviour like? When he  mentioned his distress?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “There was a discomfort in his mind. His  way of talking changed. He started
                taking long pauses as if he forgot what he  was saying.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “When did this happen?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “A couple of days before he was gone.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Ma’am, is there anyone else you know who  can go to such an extent?” Mishti
                asked.
            </p>
            <p>
                “No. Dibakar had never had enemies. He  bragged about defeating Barun sir
                every time his awards were the centre of  attention. But that’s not a reason
                to kidnap someone, is it?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Of course not. I am sure he is safe. Don’t  worry ma’am we will try our
                best to find Dibakar sir. He is my favourite  teacher.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Mrs. Banerjee gave her a smile but was  almost in tears.
            </p>
            <p>
                Kashyap and Mishti stood up when they  realised that Shrishti’s mother was
                standing at the kitchen door and listening  to the conversation. She didn’t
                intervene at all.
            </p>
            <p>
                Both of them thanked Banerjee for her  cooperation and left the house.
            </p>
            <p>
                They  entered Kahsyap’s house and both of them had the same thought in their
                mind.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Suicide?”
            </p>
            <p>
                His change in behaviour and way of talking  was noticed by Mishti too. But
                it was not as prominent as Mrs.Banerjee said.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mishti’s lips were trembling and no other  reason was looking valid enough.
                She turned towards Kashyap and saw the look of  worry on his face. Kashyap
                was the only person which made her feel that this is  going to end well.
                Now, looking at his worried face broke her. She was not able  to hold back
                the tears she held for a long time. They ran down slowly at first  and
                pretty soon she started sobbing. Kashyap looked at her and quickly hugged
                her. Her arms spontaneously wrapped around him and he had no idea how to
                handle  this situation. He stayed still for some time. Her tears were felt
                through his  shirt on his back. He tried to stop her from crying. He patted
                her back,  once-twice-thrice. He decided to wait until she pulled back. Soon
                she did. Her  face was red, eyes were soaked in tears. She apologised for
                this but Kashyap  assured he didn’t mind it at all. He held her hand and
                said, “Mishti, it’s  going to be alright. I am sure he is safe. Suicide is
                just a possibility.”  Tears started running down her cheek again. He cussed
                himself, not out loud,  for the stupid statement he just stated. “No, I
                didn’t mean that. I am sure he  is alive, safe.” He asked if she wanted to
                stay and have a nap in his bedroom.  She agreed. He made up his bed and let
                her have a long sleep. He went to his  living room and pulled out his
                softboard. Still worried about Mishti, he wrote  the names of the suspects,
                hints, clues, the motives, everything he knew about  the case. He used to
                work like this when he was in the police force many years  back. He solved
                cases using the soft boards but with time his mind got trained  to arrange
                the clues in his mind. That day, he knew that his mind would not be  able to
                hold all these variables and worry about Mishti together. He could  either
                be a detective, like he has been for years, or a companion and perhaps a
                friend to Mishti. He decided to be a friend. His hands had already started
                arranging the variables on the board and before he could think about it, the
                case was pinned on the board. Everything was there in front of his eyes. He
                was  able to look at the case but his brain was completely locked on Mishti.
                He  decided to take a nap too. It was his coping mechanism. Apparently,
                Mishti’s  too. He sat on his sofa and in no time his neck lost its strength
                and he fell asleep,  still sitting. One of his hands was on the armrest and
                the other one was on the  back pillow. His legs were tied together. His head
                hung behind the sofa’s  headrest. Not a very healthy position to sleep but
                who cared at that moment.
            </p>
            <h2>Something  Snapped</h2>
            <p>
                The class was dismissed before the bell.  Prof. Roy grabbed his bottle and
                walked out of the room. Some students decided  to hangout in the canteen,
                some went for a quick walk around the campus and a  few idiots decided to
                hit the library to complete the assignments. While these  plans were being
                made, Madhur and Sheena decided to go to Madhur’s room and  have a good time
                in solitude. Both smiled at each other and headed towards the  room. While
                walking, Sheena was asking him about his day, telling about her day.  She
                was trying to have a conversation with Madhur. He, on the other hand, went
                into some other state of mind while walking. He was thinking something.
                Sheena  understood what was going on and abruptly stopped walking. Madhun,
                unaware of  this, continued his walk. After about a dozen steps he realised
                that his  girlfriend was not with him. He turned back and there she was,
                standing with a  fake angry smile. He smiled at her and ran back.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Sorry! Sorry! Why did you stop?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “I know what’s going on Madhu!’
            </p>
            <p>
                “What do you mean?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Come on! Don’t pretend, You are still hung  up on what Prof.Joy said. Go
                find him and ask whatever you want to and clear  your mind. I’ll be waiting
                in your room.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Ahhh! You’re the best! Bye!”
            </p>
            <p>
                He kissed her on the cheek and ran towards  Prof.Roy’s cabin. She smiled and
                watched him run like a 10 year old.
            </p>
            <p>
                Madhur  arrived at the door of Prof.Roy’s cabin. He opened the door and
                rushed in in  excitement and nervousness at the same time. He didn’t knock.
                This pissed  Nikhil off. He was already upset about Aashvi — No! About the
                class (Of course  Aashvi) and this behaviour of Madhur triggered his anger.
                Somehow he gulped it  and in a calm but intimidating voice said,
            </p>
            <p>
                “Madhur! Where are you manners, Kid?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “I am sorry sir, but I didn’t under—”
            </p>
            <p>
                “I don’t care what you didn’t understand,  get out!”
            </p>
            <p>
                “No sir, I need my answers. That’s your  job. Do your job, sir.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “That won’t happen if you talk like that,  kid.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Something snapped in Nikhil’s mind. He  thought that he had heard that line
                before. Maybe he had used it too.
            </p>
            <p>
                “I am sorry sir, truly. That won’t happen  again. I am nervous because I am
                meeting you face to face for the first time.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “What’s the issue know-it-all?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “I don’t like that nickname sir, but the  actual issue is that you usually
                explain where I had gone wrong. Today you  ended it in a single sentence.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “So you need an explanation on how you  don’t communicate properly?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Yes sir, some corrections would help me a  lot.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Okay kid. How about asking before you  enter a teacher room?”
            </p>
            <p>
                Madhur understood that that was not the  right time to talk to Prof.Roy.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Sir, should I ask this later?”
            </p>
            <p>
                Nikhil forgave him for his ignorance and  told him,
            </p>
            <p>
                “Okay hear me out. —”
            </p>
            <p>
                Madhur was about to sit on the chair in  front of him.
            </p>
            <p>
                — Stand right where you are, kid.”
            </p>
            <p>
                There it was! It hit Nikhil why the  conversation was sounding familiar. A
                wide smile appeared on his face. The  moment he was waiting for all his life
                after that event, had showed up.  Nikhil’s behaviour changed completely. He
                was not Madhur’s teacher anymore.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Let your issues go to hell Know-it-all.  Stay right there. I’ll be back in
                12-15 minutes. Alright?”
            </p>
            <p>
                Madhur nodded in complete confusion. Nikhil  got up and rushed out of his
                own cabin leaving his bottle on the table. This  never happened. No one ever
                saw Prof.Roy’s bottle unattended. He left his  jacket and hat too. The only
                thing he now cared about was passing on this  legacy to Madhur.
            </p>
            <p>
                Madhur waited  there. 5 minutes, 10, 15, 20.  The door  opened. Madhur
                turned to look at who it was. Nikhil was standing there with a  bunch of
                papers in his hand. Instantly Madhur knew what it was. It was the  great
                Professor Roy’s unwritten story. His face was like a toddler’s, when he
                sees his mother after the kindergarten ends. His happiness skyrocketed.
                Nikhil  handed those papers to Madhur and said, “Look kid, this is not a
                gift or a  treat. This is a responsibility. You will know what to do with it
                when the time  is right. Understood?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Yes sir. It’s an honour.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “It may look like one. But be careful. No  one else can know about it.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Madhur agreed but he knew that he was going  to inform, brag, about it to
                Sheena.
            </p>
            <p>
                Nikhil gathered his coat and hat. He was  leaving the room when he turned
                back and said,
            </p>
            <p>
                “I am going on a long holiday, kid. Don’t  tell this to anyone. You are the
                only one who should be knowing about this.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Madhur was confused. “Why is he leaving?”
            </p>
            <p>
                But his excitement overshadowed this  thought. He ran back to his room to
                meet Sheena and tell her about it. He was  at his door when he calmed
                himself down and planned a moment to tell Sheena  about what happened that
                day. Entered the room, kept his sack on his table and  Sheena was sitting
                there reading a book Madhur had kept on that table. He  grabbed her from
                behind and they sat on his bed.
            </p>
            <p>
                “What took you so long?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “I’ll tell you everything. I am so happy  right now that I just want a
                kiss.”
            </p>
            <p>
                They kissed.
            </p>
                <h2>She Must….</h2>
            <p>
                Nikhil went home after handing the papers  to Madhur. A huge sack of
                responsibilities had just dropped down from his  shoulders. So many years
                went by to make Nikhil trust in a student, a person,  enough to hand over
                the potentially best work of his life. He knew that he  wouldn't be able to
                complete it. The brain of Nikhil Roy was too practical to  make it happen.
                He needed an emotional touch to complete the story. There had  to be a
                Mishti holding the pen which completes the story. But Nikhil was the  only
                one who knew what had happened to Dibakar Banerjee. He had to make sure
                that the climax had served justice to the premise. There was no direct way
                of  telling Madhur what had to be written. Nikhil had planned a way to do
                it. He  found the student who was smart enough and a student who was
                invested in his  lectures so much that each of his sentences were carved in
                his brain. Nikhil  finally had found the right person. Madhur had the
                sympathy possessed by Mishti  and the respect for Prof.Roy which will guide
                him to the climax. The only  gamble that Nikhil played was that of
                predicting what would happen when Madhur  gets to the part where Nikhil
                stopped writing. The reason was yet unknown to  humankind. Nikhil wanted to
                erase that particular memory but couldn't.
            </p>
            <p>
                Nikhil had a strong urge to pee and found a  small cavity in the wall beside
                the stage which said, “Mens.” He started  walking towards it when he saw it
                happen, right in front of his eyes. Nikhil  froze. Still staring at them.
                Aashvi and Dhawal had their lips locked inside  each other’s. Kumar Ji’s
                daughter cut the cake and all the people present there  started clapping.
                Nikhil looked away towards the stage and clapped too. Aashvi  and Dhawal
                were unaffected. Nikhil walked out of the party. His mind was  yelling, “Do
                it! Do it Nikhil! Now is the right time! It’s important for him.  You
                must….She must—”
            </p>
            <p>
                The morning was  bright. Mishti woke up and looked for Kashyap in the living
                room. She found him  in the same position, sleeping. She sat beside him and
                wanted to keep her head  on his arm. “He isn’t your friend Mishti, just your
                detective. You have hired him,  that’s all. But he hugged you yesterday. He
                was trying to calm you down,  nothing more than that. He could have sent you
                to your hostel to sleep. The  night was too dark. Both of us were tired. So?
                He dropped you the last time.  God!! Just do it!.” Mishti shut her thoughts
                down and decided to go for it. She  rested her head on his arm. Instantly
                Kashyap shivered and woke up. She  screamed, frightened. He was still in
                sleep, “Ahh! Why are you shouting in my  ear, kid?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “I am sorry I didn’t mean to do that.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “What?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Sit beside you.”
            </p>
            <p>
                ‘Ya you probably shouldn’t, your breath  stinks.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Excuse me!”
            </p>
            <p>
                Ke kept staring at her and they broke into  laughter.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Hey, listen. Sorry for crashing here  yesterday. I was just–”
            </p>
            <p>
                “That’s not necessary. It’s alright.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Great! Thanks. I see you got creative last  night.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Ya! I can’t be a detective and a friend at  the same time.”
            </p>
            <p>
                She smiled. Kashyap felt nice looking at  her smiling face. He was terrified
                thinking about her after seeing her cry.  They freshened up and Mishti made
                coffee for both of them. They were about to  start the discussion when
                Kashyap made Mishti look at him, “Listen to me kid,  things are getting out
                of our hands. Dibakar’s case has taken unexpected turns.  Yesterday was a
                shock for both of us but today we have to be prepared. You must  stay
                strong, partner.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “I will.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Awesome! So let’s begin. We have 3  possibilities. One, Barun kidnapped
                him. Motive: winning  the highest contributor award that will be  announced
                in some days. We have no proof against him. Two, Shweta is involved. Motive:
                replacing the teacher to get good grades in the upcoming exam. Which is not
                a  good enough motive given that she is a coward. And third, Dibakar had
                committed— exhales– he has committed suicide. It is also possible that none
                of  these possibilities are correct. To confirm this we are interrogating
                Dibakar’s  wife about the people around them.”
            </p>
            <p>
                They  reach Dibakar’s house. His mother in law, Shrishti’s mother, opened
                the door  and allowed them to enter. They sat on the sofa and waited for
                Shrishti. She  was out grocery shopping. In the meantime Kashyap asked the
                old woman some  questions.
            </p>
            <p>
                “<em>Maa ji,</em>Do you have any idea about Dibakar’s situation? Who can do
                this to  him?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Do what?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “I am talking about the disappearance. Can  you tell us anything about it?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Shrishti is very disturbed after what has  happened. She walks around the
                house and doesn’t talk much. Going out of the  house helps her be calm.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “That’s not what I am asking <em>Maa ji</em>. I need you to tell me about
                the  people with whom Dibakar had meetings and conversations daily.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Stop pushing her Kashyap. Maybe she is not  able to understand what you are
                saying. Let’s wait for Shrishti Ji.”
            </p>
            <p>
                They waited.
            </p>
            <p>
                Shrishti knocked on the door. Her mother  opened it again. She saw them
                sitting on her sofa looking at her. Staring. The  bright sun and heat had
                already messed up with her mind, She was not ready for  any more surprises.
                She asked, “What are you doing here? Did you sneak in while  I was out?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “No ma’am, we promise that is not the case.  Detective Kashyap and I wanted
                to ask you some more questions.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Again! Listen to me folks. Neither you  have the authority to enter my
                house and nor am I willing to give any. You guys  don’t answer my questions
                properly and ask 10 of your own! Please, it's a  request. Please leave.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Ma’am, our husband has not gone missing,  it’s yours. Be grateful that we
                are doing something about it”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Kashyap!” Mishti exclaimed, “I am sorry  for that. He didn’t mean it.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Shrishti started crying and Mishti rushed  towards her. She wanted to help
                with the bags. Shrishti stopped her and took a  step back. She pointed their
                way out of her house and ordered them to leave.  The order turned into a
                threat the next second. They had no choice but to  leave.
            </p>
            <p>
                On  their way back Mishti scolded Kashyap, she was right this time.
            </p>
            <p>
                “What the hell was that Detective?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “She is being irrational.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Her husband has gone missing, her mother  is not able to contemplate this
                or any situation around her. Do you expect a  human being to be rational in
                such times?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Okay, but we need to get answers about her  soon.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “We will, or let her inform the police  first, they will help us for sure.
                Won’t they?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “I am not sure about that but let’s just  assume they would. You have your
                lecture soon right? Go attend it. I have to  interrogate Barun after the
                lectures. You don’t have to be there.”
            </p>
            <p>
                She agreed and left Kashyap in a Rickshaw.  Kashyap went home and stared at
                his soft board. He kept the fact that there is  no proof against any suspect
                in mind. He thought about the questions he had to  ask Barun after a while.
                He took a sheet of paper and noted the questions down.  When he gave the
                list a second look, he found that some questions were not very  safe to ask
                an insecure man like Barun. It was not good for Mishti. He decided  not to
                ask them.
            </p>
            <p>
                They had decided  to meet at Kashyap’s home first so that Mishti could
                cancel out some questions  that she thought would not be safe for her.
                Kashyap had already sent a notice  to Barun through another student so that
                Mishti would be out of his mind. He  was waiting for Mishti to knock on his
                door. There was a knock but it was a kid  from Kashyap’s building. The kid
                said, “Your friend told me to get you down and  bring 15 rupees for the
                rickshaw. She is short on cash.” Kashyap told him to  carry on with whatever
                he was doing. He grabbed his wallet and went down.  Kashyap walked out of
                the building and a fruit vendor almost hit him on the  road with his
                pushcart. Kashyap didn’t mind it. One of the oranges on the cart  fell down
                and Kashyap picked it up. While he was keeping it on the cart the  vendor
                apologised and Kashyap assured him that he was not hurt. He saw Mishti  on
                the opposite side of the road. She waved him to cross the road and Kashyap
                raised his hand, singing, “Wait right there.” He looked out for any vehicles
                on  the road, right-left-right-. He started crossing the road when he saw
                that the <em>Rickshaw-wala</em> pulled out a pistol from his pants and shot
                Mishti in the head. The people on the road were terrified and started
                running  away. Kashyap, stood there in the middle of the road while he saw
                Mishti’s  corpse, wide opened eyes and mouth, falling dead on the ground. He
                ran towards  her trying to catch her before her head hit the ground. He
                couldn’t. He picked  her head up and tapped her cheek. ‘Mishti! Mishti! Kid
                please wake up. Don’t do  this. Kid!” His tears were falling on her face, as
                dead as she was. He looked  out for the rickshaw but it had long gone away.
                Kashyap screamed for help but  the chaos made him inaudible. Kashyap stayed
                there with her head on his lap,  crying, sobbing and screaming for help.
                After an hour the police arrived on the  scene and arrested Kashyap for
                interrogation. He tried resisting but his body  had no energy to do so. He
                was in the lockup and had a dead soul inside him.  The police officer took
                him out and asked him many questions. About his  relation with her, her
                background, his background. The officer repeated many  questions which
                pissed Kashyap off. He yelled,
            </p>
            <p>
                “Why are you asking me the same questions  again and again and again! Go
                find the driver. Idiots! Where were you when that  bastard pulled out the
                gin and shot my friend?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Are you in the right state of mind? Do you  have any idea who you are
                talking to right now?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “I am surprised that you expect me to be  rational in such a situation! She
                died right in front of me.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Kashyap was right. Mishti died right in  front of him. Dead. There was no
                way to undo what had happened. If he had not  bumped into the cart, not
                picked up the orange. If he had crossed the road  sooner. If he had picked
                her up right from the college itself. It would have  been better if he never
                met her. He would be a detective.
            </p>
            <p>
                “The  driver waited for me, didn’t he?”
            </p>
            <h2>Who? And  Where?</h2>
            <p>
                Madhur and Sheena started reading those  pages. Both were excited to know
                why Prof.Roy left his story unwritten. They  had never read any book in
                their life as fast as they were doing it now. The  glimpses of Kashyap’s
                world were flashing before their eyes. Mishti’s  innocence, Kashyap’s
                intellect, the hate for Shweta everything felt relatable.  They had met
                people like these characters in their lives. They were very close  to the
                last few pages. They read.
            </p>
            <p>
                The  investigation of Mishti’s case was going on. Kashyap was not allowed to
                leave  the city. All he could do was sit and wait for any lead that the
                police could  find. He was not allowed to interfere in the case in any way.
                Fortunately or  unfortunately there was no record of Mishti investigating
                Dibakar sir’s case.  Shweta was scared to open her mouth, Barun thought that
                Mishti was not involved  in the case. The police didn’t ask Shrishti. She
                was out of the picture.  Kashyap knew that the police didn’t know about
                their investigation. He decided  to take a break from the investigation. He
                went home and started reading some  books, tried to sleep. Nothing worked.
                His shopping mechanism was too weak to  help him get out of his thoughts.
                The only way out Kashyap could find was  alcohol. He went to the nearest bar
                and filled himself up. The bar started  swirling around. The bartender was
                spinning in front of him. A man sat beside  him and ordered a drink.
                Kashyap’s body was not used to alcohol. He felt a  punch in his stomach.
                Still he was not aware that there was a man beside him.  The alcohol didn’t
                stay in. He puked on that muscular dude sitting beside him.  Filled with
                rage he yelled and slapped him hard. The swirling paced up. Kashyap  felt
                the punch in his stomach again. This time, it was an actual punch. The
                guards were somehow able to control that man, beast, and save Kashyap. He
                ran  away. It was a silent night. The street had no sign of humans. He
                didn’t know  what way was home. Kashyap kept walking. The dogs barked at the
                deaf. The  street lights flickered over a blind. Kashyap had no senses
                working for him.  Except his sense of smell. He smelled Mishti’s hair, it
                was the smell he  registered when she was sobbing in his arms. He felt like
                she was walking with  him. He wanted to talk to her, ask her why she hired
                him. He did. She kept  walking in silence. He gave up. He joined her in the
                silence.
            </p>
            <p>
                A  splash of water was sprinkled on his face. An old woman was on her knees,
                trying to wake him up. When he opened his eyes, she made him sit up. She
                gave  him some water to drink and asked him where he lived. Still hungover,
                he told  his society’s name.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Oh My God! You live far away from here,  kid. How much did you drink last
                night?”
            </p>
            <p>
                Kashyap was silent.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Don’t worry, you look like a nice man.  I’ll have my son drop you there.
                Let’s get you off the street first.”
            </p>
            <p>
                After a while Kashyap realised that he  passed out on a random street far
                away from his home and the bar. He let the  old woman guide him. Her son
                arrived there soon and dropped him off at his  door. Kashyap searched for
                the keys and fortunately he had the bunch with him.  He entered his home and
                thanked the boy. He went straight to his bed and tried  to sleep. His
                clothes, hair, mouth, everything on him was stinking. He decided  to take a
                shower. He did. He laid on the bed and closed his eyes, hoping to  have a
                good sleep. But the glimpses of Mishti were not letting him calm down at
                all. “Time for a drink!” He thought. He wanted to go to a bar but the events
                that happened the day before won’t let him. He bought a bottle home. As soon
                as  he closed the main door, he opened the bottle and started gulping it
                straight  from the mouth. He emptied half of it in himself and then paused
                for a breath.  Took a breath and finished the remaining half. The dizziness
                was not as  prominent as the day before. He waited for Mishti to leave his
                brain. She  didn’t. He had no idea of what time it was. The first thoughts
                in his mind  started to become his actions. He smashed the bottle on the
                wall and got out of  his house.
            </p>
            <p>
                Where  was he headed? To Shweta’s room. He walked through the college gate.
                Walked  towards the girl’s hostel. His detective muscle memory kicked in.
                His steps  were unheard. He was not seen by anyone because of the dark. It
                was 11 O’clock.  He knocked on Shweta’s door, the resistance of letting
                girls study resulted in  each girl having a room of her own in hostels. He
                banged on Shweta’s door. She  opened it thinking of a friend playing a prank
                on her. She trusted the security  guard who went to buy <em>beedis</em>for
                himself. She tried to scream out loud but Kashyap’s hand had tightly
                squeezed  her mouth. With no sign of any security around, he got her out of
                the college.  Shweta had disappeared into the thin air in the middle of the
                night. The  college was terrified. The girls started to move out of the
                hostel everyday.  The authorities were questioned, by the police, parents
                and everyone. First it  was Mishti and now Shweta. The students were living
                with a terrified soul. The  classes were empty. The mess was clear. For two
                days Shweta had shown no  presence. The police used to struggle finding any
                evidence before CCTVs were  invented. They had two big cases to solve.
            </p>
            <p>
                ‘Who? and Where?’
            </p>
            <p>
                Kashyap  had a basement under nowhere. He had locked Shweta inside it. His
                brain was  rotting day by day. The human inside him was brought down to
                giving her just  what she needs to survive. Food, water etc. He was waiting
                to fill the second  chair. When he was home, he knew that the officers were
                going to interrogate  him. He kept himself sober at that time. The soft
                board was hidden in his  bedroom. Interrogations with the police went
                smoothly. He knew the tricks  police used to strangle you in their web of
                questions. He made his way out of  it. The day arrived.
            </p>
            <p>
                2 days after  kidnapping Shweta, he found a way to kidnap Barun. Getting to
                him in the  college was impossible after Mishti’s death. He found where
                Barun lived. Where  he visited occasionally and everything else he did on a
                daily basis. Barun had  to walk a long narrow street home. Rickshaw’s were
                reluctant to enter the  street and turning back was a huge task. Kashyap
                waited for Barun with an iron  rod. He knew exactly where to hit a grown
                human to make him unconscious but  keep him alive. The street was dead. No
                soul wandered around at 10 in the  night. Except one. The teacher who comes
                home after his lectures. Barun was  halfway through the street when Kashyap
                heard his footsteps and they got  closer. BAM!! He missed. Of course a
                bottle of alcohol makes your motor skills  weak. There was no way Kashyap
                had the courage to do this sober. BAM! The  second hit landed before Barun
                was able to react. Kashyap dragged him out of  the street and tied Barun to
                himself while he sat on a rented bike. No blood  shed, no traces of
                kidnapping. Catching the criminals trains you it seems. He  got Barun in the
                same basement where Shweta was lying on the floor helpless. He  opened the
                door and Shweta tried to scream her call of help out. Didn’t work.  He was
                drunk, but still strong. Physically. He waited for Barun to wake up and
                investigate Dibakar's case in his own way. He had left the legality part way
                behind him.

                “Madhur! What  kind of crap is this? There is no logic in this story
                anymore. Did the  Professor run out of stuff to write?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “You know it too, Sheena. That's not  possible.”

            <p>
                “I get it. But this???”
            </p>
            <p>
                Madhur went back a few pages. Read it again  while Sheena stared at him.
                Madhur reached the page they stopped on. He took a  moment to analyse why
                Roy sir would write these blunders of logic.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Read this Sheena, Do you expect a human  being to be rational in such
                times? Can this be about Nikhil sir’s actual  life?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “We may have to go to his hometown to find  it out. But it makes sense now,
                kind of.”
            </p>
            <p>
                They read.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Now  tell me what you have done.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “What do you mean?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Don’t pretend you bastards. I know you are  involved in Dibakar’s case.
                Tell me what have you done.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “We haven’t done anything. Why are you  assuming things? Do you have any
                proof against us?” Barun cried.
            </p>
            <p>
                “No! – Shweta paused – No he doesn’t! – She  laughed – “He can’t prove who
                did it sir, This poor failed detective. He has no  choice but to make us
                confess that we did it.”
            </p>
            <p>
                She got up from the chair and walked up to  him. Stared right into Kashyap’s
                eyes. With confidence and authority she said,  “Now you listen to me
                Detective. I know there is no way you can prove us  guilty. We aren’t. If
                you think you can make us criminals in the eyes of the  world just by
                threatening us, you are so damn wrong.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Kashyap felt helpless. His eyes watered.  The only thing that Mishti ever
                wished from Kashyap seemed to fly away from his  grip. Dibakar sir seemed
                untraceable. Shweta was a coward, she is still. All  the authority and
                bravery was coming with the accurate assumption that Kashyap  won’t hurt
                them in any way. They were in complete control of the situation.  Soon Barun
                stood up and mocked him, “Has the genius gone dumb? Detective  Kashyap?”
                Kashyap was not able to intimidate them in any way. He pushed Barun  hard on
                the table. He fell down. Shweta went to help him get up and in the  right
                time Kashyap escaped from his own trap that backfired.
            </p>
            <p>
                While  reading, Sheena noticed a hole on the last page of the bunch. She
                immediately  turned the set and it looked like someone had stabbed a pencil
                in. They guessed  that while writing the story Professor Roy got carried
                away and did it. They  got goosebumps. How can someone be so involved in his
                story that he forgot that  it is a story.
            </p>
            <p>
                Madhur said, “He must have already  experienced the loss of a close one.
                Maybe very soon before writing it.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Sheena added, “Do you think that was the  reason Nikhil sir decided to go
                irrational? Is it a metaphor?”
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>
                    Unintentionally it actually metaphorized  Nikhil. He was already in
                    tears when he started writing about Mishti's death.  The lead of the
                    pencil on the paper had distorted at some places, very light to  be
                    noticed in the first or second reading. His hands were writing the words
                    before his mind could process it. It was all raw emotions that Nikhil
                    had  locked up somewhere inside him. Those emotions took over the
                    practicality and  made him write those instances which don’t make any
                    sense.
                </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                Kashyap  rushed back home. He took out the soft board from the back of his
                bed and tore  some of the notes. “Damn it!” He said.
                <strong>
                    “Damn  it!” He said.
                </strong>
                He grabbed some extra sheets and refilled the cavities on the  board.
                Kashyap banged his head on the wall on which the soft board was resting.
                <strong>He banged his hand on the table.</strong>He  was restless.
                <strong>
                    He was too.
                </strong>
                He ran his  fingers through every thread that he had tangled around the
                board pins. Every  variable was revisited. Nothing. There was no evidence.
                “Why is this not making  any sense!” he screamed.
                <strong>
                    “Nothing makes  sense Kashyap! I am better than him. Still…”
                </strong>
                He tore down the suspects  names from the board. “No” switched to another
                suspect. “Not him” Switched.  “She neither.” The room was dark. Kashyap was
                making all his moves without  seeing anything in his house. His brain was
                making the way for him. Showing his  surroundings bright which his eyes
                couldn’t see in the dark. “Where are you  Dibakar! Mishti, please come
                back!”
                <strong>
                    “Why  won’t she come back!” Nikhil’s hand was not able to write. The
                    micro movements  of the fingers were not able to radiate the rage filled
                    in Nikhil. His hand  started to shiver. There were random lines on the
                    page after the word ‘back!’  and BAM! He stabbed the page with the
                    pencil. Made a small hole on that page.
                </strong>
                Kashyap  was screaming. Again and again. “Mishti, please come back!”
                Kashyap’s house  collapsed. Big part of his floor fell down along with him.
                The man who lived  below him was cut in half, vertically. The part that was
                inside the fallen  floor disappeared, the part outside of it stayed as it
                was. The floor had no  surface to fall on. The floor below it fell down too.
                So did the floor below  that. There was a huge black and dark nothing.
                Nothing above the hole. Nothing  below. The world of Kashyap collapsed into
                that hole.

                    Some kind of lightning struck Nikhil as soon as he stabbed that pencil.
                    Blinding and deafening him for a while. When he got up, his room had
                    quaked.  Nothing was at its original place except his story. He stood up
                    and looked at  the pages. They were the same as he left them. He read
                    the story’s last page.  He understood that something was wrong. He had
                    to stop writing. He would make  himself worse and the story too. Nikhil
                    packed up all his stuff and locked the  room. Handed the key to Kumar ji
                    and paid the rent for the whole month. He ran  away. He had a random
                    story written long ago which he submitted to his agency  and resigned
                    right away. He left the city, the state and got settled in a  metro-city
                    where writers could earn more. He started writing articles and when  he
                    had enough money he published a book of his short stories. Then he wrote
                    books with some of the concepts he had in his mind. Soon he manages to
                    put  Kashyap behind him and carry on with his life. His stories inspired
                    many writers  and impressed some universities of literature. He was
                    offered a job at National  Institute Of Literary Arts. He grabbed that
                    opportunity and started teaching  the new aspiring writers. It took him
                    years till he made his peace with Kashyap  and then he started telling
                    his students about the story that he was never able  to finish.

            <h2>You Came Out  Of The Story!</h2>
            <p>
                Madhur and Sheena were immersed in those  pages. Reading every word and
                visualising Kashyap’s agony. They had no idea of  the remaining pages.
                Madhur and Sheena had the same pace of reading so no one  had to wait for
                the other person to finish reading. The switching happened very  smoothly.
                They had the habit of putting the read page at the back of the bundle  while
                holding the complete bundle in their hand. There was no way they knew  that
                the last page of the bundle was close. It arrived. Both were reading. “The
                room was dark. Kashyap was making all his moves without seeing anything in
                his  house. His brain was making the way for him. Showing his surroundings
                bright  which his eyes couldn’t see in the dark. “Where are you Dibakar!
                Mishti, please  come back!” Kashyap was screaming. Again
                and again.  “Mishti, please come back!”” Then they saw the hole in the
                paper.
            </p>
            <p>
                A  man out of thin air fell down on the floor. Sheena and Madhur were
                screaming.  Yelling on the top of their voice. Kashyap started screaming
                too. “Who are  you?” More of an exclamation than a question.
            </p>
            <p>
                Madhur exclaimed, “Me! Who am I? Bitch who  are you? What are you doing in
                my room? How did you even get in here?”
            </p>
            <p>
                Sheena was still yelling.
            </p>
            <p>
                Kashyap asked with a comparatively lower  voice, “Are you Mehta ji’s new
                tenants?”
            </p>
            <p>
                Madhur, still screaming, “Who the hell is  Mehta ji and more importantly,
                who the hell are you?”
            </p>
            <p>
                Madhur looked at Sheena, screaming and  started screaming too.
            </p>
            <p>
                Kashyap was requesting them to stop  yelling. Once-twice-thrice. SMACK! He
                slapped Madhur so hard that he lost his  senses for a while. He stopped
                yelling. Sheena on the other hand was in tears,  still shouting. Kashyap
                raised his hand to slap her too but she fainted before  the hand made
                contact. Kashyap took a step back. He let the room become quiet.  It did.
                Madhur got in his senses and just when he was about to start yelling  again
                Kashyap shushed him.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Hey! Hey kid, I am not a danger to you.  Just tell me where I am.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Breathing like a horse, Madhur replied,  “National Institute of Literary
                Arts.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “What! How did I come here?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Sorry I have no idea about people  teleporting through air and falling on
                their asses.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Come on kid, this is not a time for  sarcasm.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Ya I guess. But surely it is time to tell  me who you are!”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Oh! Sorry. I am Kashyap. I am a detective.  I think there was an earthquake
                at my place. But how did I end up here? What is  this place exactly?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “This is Bhubaneshwar. Odisha. Where are  you from?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “I am from….. I don’t actually know.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Hey! This is no time to crack jokes  either. Tell me where you are from or
                else we are going to report you. I am  Shee– Sheenaaaa! What did you do to
                her, you bastard!”
            </p>
            <p>
                “He is just scared. Don’t worry she will be  back soon.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Wait! What did you say your name was? You  are Detective Kashyap?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Yeah! Do you know me?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Mister, I am telling you this is not a  good time to crack jokes. How do
                you know about Kashyap?”
            </p>
            <p>
                Kashyap stopped him, “Detective Kashyap.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Ya whatever. How do you know about him?  Did Roy sir tell him about you?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Who is Mr.Roy now?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Don’t you dare carry this prank on! There  are only 3 people in this world
                that know about Kashyap. Me, Sheena and Roy  sir.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Thousands of people know me, kid. I have  been in the newspapers several
                times.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Newspapers? Kashyap is in a story.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “What story?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “This story! The famously incomplete work  of Roy sir.”
            </p>
            <p>
                ‘Give me those papers.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Kashyap read the first two chapters written  on the sheets. Dropped them as
                soon as he realised it. It was like a  thunderstruck. He held his head
                tightly in palms, trying to counter his  headache with the physical pain he
                could generate with his palms. Didn’t work  well. He ignored the pain and
                told Madhur, “Listen to me kid. This may sound  ridiculous. But–”
            </p>
            <p>
                Madhur interrupted, “You came out of the  story!”
            </p>
            <p>
                “You understand it?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “I am not sure that’s true but there is no  other way to explain the hole in
                the page and Roy sir leaving the story  incomplete.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “It’s okay for you to have doubts. But you  have to tell me where your Roy
                sir is.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “I don’t actually know. A couple of hours  ago he left. He handed me the
                papers and left.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Where?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “I have no clue. Oh My God! We have to do  it all over again Kashyap.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Sheena woke up and started screaming again.  Madhur held her head and calmed
                her down. He explained the situation to him.  She didn’t buy it. She kept
                questioning Kashyap and he didn’t like this  behaviour of hers. Her tone
                started getting dominant and Kashyap couldn’t take  it. He told Madhur that
                he was going to find Roy sir. He opened the door and a  bunch of students
                were standing outside the door. They were there because of  the screaming.
                Madhur assured that everything was fine and Kashyap walked off.  Madhur
                kissed Sheena and told her that he was going to join Kashyap. He did.
            </p>
            <p>
                Kashyap  was walking down the stairs. Everything was different in this
                world. The boys’  hostel was not the dirtiest place on earth. The kids had
                dressed funny, vibrant  shirts with no buttons. “How do they put it on?” he
                thought. And for some  reason these kids were greeting him like a professor.
                Kashyap was walking his  way out of the hostel when Madhur caught up.
                Kashyap asked him the reason for  the students thinking of him as a teacher.
                Madhur pointed out the fact that  Kashyap was actually dressed like a
                professor.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Why don’t you guys have buttons? Isn’t it  more difficult to put your
                shirts all the way through?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “More difficult than passing those little  beads through little slits of
                cloth? More than once?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “It doesn’t get stuck?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “It’s elastic, UNCLE!”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Okay nevermind. Why are you following me?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “What do you mean? Aren’t I joining you in  the search?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “No! I can do it by myself.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Really? You just came to know about  T-Shirts.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “I’ll figure it out, kid. Leave me alone. I  don’t need a partner.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Kashyap walked away and Madhur slowed  himself. Although he didn’t give up.
                He kept his distance but didn’t leave  Kashyap. Kashyap asked about
                Professor Roy’s office. He headed towards the  information he received from
                the students. He was aware that Madhur was  following him. Madhur knew that
                Kashyap knew. So he didn’t worry about being  discreet. When Kashyap reached
                the door it was locked, obviously. He bent down  and saw that there was no
                latch to close it. It had a knob. That was it.  Confused, he asked Madhur
                whether they use any safety measures or not. Kashyap  thought there was no
                lock on that door. Still it won’t open. Madhur laughed and  explained to him
                the concept of locks in his world. He knew that they didn’t  have the same
                locks back when Roy sir wrote the story but it surprised him when  he
                actually thought about it. Madhur told him that the mechanism is the same as
                a traditional lock, the difference was that now the lock was attached to the
                door. Kashyap wanted to enter the room but there was no way to do so. He
                banged  the door hard, tried to take out some frustration. Didn’t help.
            </p>
            <p>
                “But why do you want to find Roy sir?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “I have to get some answers kid, some  unfinished business to settle. Is
                there any way to find out where Roy has  gone?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “I don’t think so, Kashyap. He was not a  social being. No one actually
                knows about his past. All we know about him is  through his written stories.
                And now the unwritten one too.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Damn it!”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Where could he go? Did he tell you  anything?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “No. He just went. I don’t think he wants  us to find him.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “He does. Somehow, I just know.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Kashyap walked away.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Where are you going?” <br/>
                <br/>
            </p>
            <p>
                “I don’t know. Don’t follow me kid.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Sheena arrived at the office and saw Madhur  following Kashyap. She joined
                them. Madhure was requesting Kashyap to let him  help in the search.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Kashyap, Detective! Please let me come.  You know I won’t go away so
                easily.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Focus on your studies kid. Go away.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Madhur was trying his best to convince him.  Pleading, irritating,
                bargaining and everything he could. But Kashyap didn’t  have his ears on
                Madhur. Sheena, who was quietly walking with Mahur, spoke up.  Kashyap
                didn’t know she was there.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Mishti was not your fault detective!”
            </p>
            <p>
                Kadhyap stopped. Madhur was surprised with  such a bold statement from
                Sheena. She was the one who used to run her doubts  through Madhur to ensure
                if they were worth asking. Kashyap turned back and  stormed towards Sheena.
                He got close to her, looked her in the eyes and slapped  her hard on the
                cheek. It was unexpected, even for Kashyap. She fell down on  her knees and
                Madhur pushed him back. He began walking out of the scene when  Sheena
                repeated, “It’s not your fault detective!” Madhur tried to stop her but  she
                said it again. Madhur was re-evaluating his perception  of Sheena. Madhir
                decided that it was time to  use his aces. This was the time when Kashyap
                had some ear on them.
            </p>
            <p>
                While  leaving, Nikhil told Madhur that Kashyap may not be willing to
                include him in  the investigation. Madhur didn’t know if there was any
                investigation which was  going to take place. He asked about it. Nikhil
                resisted telling him anything  about the investigation. He told him to
                remember that if a situation like that  arrived he must take the help of
                John Donne. He said that Kashyap would not  resist him.
            </p>
            <p>
                Madhur,  holding Sheena in his hands, “No man is an Island, entire of
                itself. Kashyap!  Remember?” It was the poem that Kashyap read in the
                newspaper on the day he met  Mishti for the first time. Sheena was confused.
                “How did Madhur know what was  in that poem section?”
            </p>
            <p>
                She didn’t ask. Kashyap turned back and  called Madhur. Sheena joined in.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Madhur, did Roy tell you to say that?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Sure he did.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Well it seems that he wants me to work  with you. And now we know that we
                have to find Nikhil.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “To know who kidnapped Dibakar?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Yeah. Sure.”
            </p>
            <p>
                They went to Madhur’s room where it all  started.
            </p>
            <h2>Roy’s a  genius!</h2>
            <p>
                Kashyap, “I need you folks to help me out  here. We need some information
                about your teacher.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Madhur, “He is not a human Kashyap! Stop  picturing him as one.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Kashyap, “Oh come on! Don’t idolise him. He  is a human you kids.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Sheena, “You know he created you right? You  should be the last person who
                says not to idolise him.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Kashyap, “Let’s keep your philosophies  aside, Sheena. Tell me about Roy.
                What were his distinguishers? Visually?”
            </p>
            <p>
                Sheena, “It’s simple logic you failed  detective. No philosophies! And to
                answer your question he wore a jacket all  the time! A hat too.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Madhur, “Can there be easter eggs planted  in his lectures? I mean clearly
                he wants us to find him. The only way he could  have dropped hints is
                through his lectures.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Kashyap, “There is no other student-teacher  interaction in your college?”
            </p>
            <p>
                Sheena, “Oh I am sorry. We don’t have a  college like yours. Oh no wait. You
                didn’t go to college because you are not a  human!!”
            </p>
            <p>
                Kashyap, “Shut up, kid. Show this boldness  when you don’t have a backup
                on.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Sheena, “What do you mean by that?”
            </p>
            <p>
                Madhur, “Let’s just stay on the topic.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Sheena, “No wait a minute. What do you mean  by not having a backup?”
            </p>
            <p>
                Kashyap, “People like you bring out the  fake alpha when you know that you
                are invulnerable in the moment. But as soon  as the other party pulls out
                his aces, you cry like a little baby! That’s the  original version of you,
                kid.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Sheena, “Oh really, is that so? Don’t you  dare think of me as Shweta.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Kashyap, “Alright. Surprise!!”
            </p>
            <p>
                He pulled out a revolver from his jacket  and pointed it at her. He pulled
                the hammer back and continued, “What do you  have to say now Shweta! There
                is no law and order for me in this world. I can  do it. You know I can.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Sheena tried her best not to freak out but  couldn’t. She screamed and got
                behind Madhur. She held his shoulders tightly.  Madhur freaked out too but
                he was collected. He raised his hand and told  Kashyap to let it go. Kashyap
                took it back.
            </p>
            <p>
                Kashyap, “You get it now Sheena? Or should  I say, Shweta?’
            </p>
            <p>
                Sheena, “Keep your case to yourself  detective. I and Madhur are not going
                to be a part of it. Now get out of this  room.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Kashyap, “You are free to leave, actually I  insist you to leave but I don’t
                think Madhur agrees with you.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Both of them looked at Madhur and Sheena  demanded an answer.
            </p>
            <p>
                Madhur, “It’s important to find Roy sir,  Sheena.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Sheena, “Are you kidding me Madhu!”
            </p>
            <p>
                Kashyap, “Awwww! MADHU! Someone’s sweet  tongue just came out.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Sheena, “Stay out of it!”
            </p>
            <p>
                Madhur, “Answer me Madhur. Me or him?”
            </p>
            <p>
                Kashyap, “Don’t go there Sheena, you’ll be  disappointed.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Madhur, fed up, “Okay now shut up you two!  We are here to find Roy sir. Now
                it will be very nice behaviour of not arguing  and actually thinking about
                the case.”
            </p>
            <p>
                There was a pin drop silence in the room.  They agreed on not talking about
                it anymore but Sheena and Kashyap sat distant  from each other. Madhur was
                tired of the silly argument but secretly enjoyed  being the centre of
                attention.
            </p>
            <p>
                Madhur, “Alright. So where were we?”
            </p>
            <p>
                Sheena, “Hints in lectures.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Madhur, “Right. Where can Roy sir plant  them?”
            </p>
            <p>
                Kashyap, “Was there any instance where the  class was completely confused
                about what your teacher said?”
            </p>
            <p>
                Sheena, “Multiple. His opinions were  sometimes very different from others.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Kashyap, “Elaborate.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Sheena, “There was one lecture where he  said that he thinks movies are a
                better choice than books.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Madhur, “He didn’t say that Sheena. He just  said that some people would
                prefer to save time watching a movie instead of  going through the text.
                Can’t believe you are still holding that grudge!”
            </p>
            <p>
                Sheena, “No I am not. I was just telling  Kashyap about the instances. Don’t
                blame it on me!”
            </p>
            <p>
                Kashyap, “That’s not a good lead, thanks  for trying!”
            </p>
            <p>
                Madhur, “Hey what about the time when he  said he was ready to give up
                literature?”
            </p>
            <p>
                Sheena, “Well looks like he has now. Oh  Mahur!! How can we forget about
                that poem!!”
            </p>
            <p>
                Madhur, “Which poem? The one that he told  us before the antagonist
                lecture?”
            </p>
            <p>
                Sheena, “Yupp! That one.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Madhur, “I asked our seniors about it. It  was just a way to mess with our
                critical thinking so that he can get the  lecture done with no serious
                doubts asked by the students.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Sheena, “I am a bit sceptical about it  though. If he planned on doing it,
                isn’t he smart enough to keep it subtle?”
            </p>
            <p>
                Kashyap, “What was the poem?”
            </p>
            <p>
                Sheena, “I don’t remember it all.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Madhur, “I must have written it in rough.

            <p>
                All three of them kept their eyes on the  lines. An hour passed by. Two,
                Three. Their minds wandered around other  possibilities too but their eyes
                were on those lines. Sheena gave up. She told  them that she had to return
                to the hostel. The moon was up now. Madhur took his  mind out of the lines
                thinking that they actually made no sense. He told  Kashyap that he was
                going to have dinner and asked if he wanted some. Kashyap  denied. Madhur
                went to the mess. He had his dinner with his friends which kept  his mind
                off the case for a while. He made excuses about Sheena’s screaming  during
                the day. Joked about a couple of things. He came back to his room and  his
                eyes widened like never before. He saw his room like a pile of Librarian
                trash. His novels, short story books, plays, everything was on the floor and
                on  the bed. Everywhere except for the shelves and his table. He asked for
                an  explanation but Kashyap didn’t bother to provide one. Madhur was very
                tired,  tired enough to ignore this behaviour of a guest. He picked up the
                books on the  bed and kept them on the floor as Kashyap wanted them to be
                and slept on the  bed. He tried thinking about the case but his mind logged
                off as soon as his  eyelids closed. Kashyap stayed up all night.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sheena  knocked on Madhur’s door the next day. He opened. She witnessed what
                Madhur’s  eyes witnessed the day before. There was a tiny bit of difference
                though.  Instead of a man searching for clues in the pile of books there was
                a guy, half  dead standing by the door and another man, rotting, collapsed
                on the floor.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sheena, “What the hell happened here?”
            </p>
            <p>
                Madhur, “We've been brainstorming since  5AM.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Sheena, “When did you sleep?”
            </p>
            <p>
                Madhur, “Me- 12. Kashyap- never.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Sheena, “You guys are freaks. Any leads?”
            </p>
            <p>
                Kashyap, “We are lying dead on the floor  for half an hour! I broke into the
                college's head office to find father clues  but the only address Roy
                recorded was his house here. So , No! No leads.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Sheena, “Did I mention yesterday, he  carried a bottle of tea with him all
                the time. He was very fond of tea.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Kashyap, “Well that might work.”
            </p>
            <p>
                They stayed in the room for another 3 hours  after having their breakfast.
                Kashyap wasn’t hungry. They got back to finding  clues when Kashyap stood up
                abruptly in a discussion.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Heyy! Wait! I guess we have Roy’s  location.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Madhur, “What! Seriously! Where?”
            </p>
            <p>
                Kashyap had a smile on his face. He was  impressed. “Oh My God! Roy’ s a
                genius!”
            </p>
            <p>
                Sheena, “Quit the suspense! Tell us!”
            </p>
            <p>
                Kashyap explained.
            </p>

                “First line- Addiction of your champagne  defines love.

                He loved tea right. Darjeeling tea is known  as the champagne of teas! He is
                in Darjeeling guys!”
            </p>
            <p>
                Sheena, “That’s it? You got both of us  hyped up for this stupid analogy?”
            </p>
            <p>
                Kashyap, “Stay with me dear.

                Sundarban is recognised as a UNESCO world  heritage site. That’s in West

            </p>
            <p>
                Sheena did have an argument with Madhur  about having his lectures from the
                next day. But she knew she was fighting a  lost battle. Madhur packed his
                stuff but Sheena decided not to go with them.  Strict parents and hostel
                faculty won’t let her. She kissed Madhur goodbye as  she knew that he would
                leave as soon as possible. She went to her room.
            </p>
            <h2>He Left?</h2>

                Kashyap and Madhur were on the train for  Darjeeling. It was a 20 hour ride.
                Their seats were facing each other. Madhur  had packed his ‘Crime and
                Punishment’ with him and Kashyap was empty handed. 5  hours went by.
                Madhur’s eyes got tired of reading the words. They wanted to see  something
                that was real. He closed the book and looked at Kashyap, staring out  of the
                window. “There’s nothing real here to see.” His eyes told him. Madhur
                looked out the window to see what Kashyap was hooked at. What he saw was
                nature’s  beauty. The land was green as far as the eyes could see. The sky
                was blue. The  sunlight reflected from the dew drops on the trees, the grass
                and the bushes.  He asked Kashyap, “Enjoying nature Kashyap?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “No. My mind was planning our next steps.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “For 5 hours?!”
            </p>
            <p>
                “It’s been 5 hours? Felt like 1.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Really? I am sure the greenery has been  here for just half an hour or so.
                How did you manage to stay quiet before  that?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “I don’t know. It felt less.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Wait! Oh My God! You are a character!”
            </p>
            <p>
                “What do you mean?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “I mean that you have no sense of time!  Writers usually take 5-6 days to
                write events that took place in one day! Your  one day is like 5 days for
                us. How long did you think you were up last night?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “I noticed that too. The sun came up before  I thought it would.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Isn’t it fascinating! So this strip would  probably feel like 4-5 hours to
                you.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Maybe!”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Damn! So it’s just me who is bored! Tell  me about your world.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “It is actually the same as this one. The  difference is that some people
                know me there. And the clothes I am wearing are  less stared at. If someone
                wears clothes like you guys wear here, people might  laugh at you for
                dressing up like a clown.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Really! Why? These are good clothes.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Okay let me put it this way, that guy  right there has a shirt on that says
                ‘Psyched!’ with a cat wearing sunglasses.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “It serves the purpose.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “What purpose? Having people stay away from  it?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Alright, never mind!”
            </p>
            <p>
                They talked for a while. Kashyap started  liking Madhur. He reminded him
                about Mishti. After talking for a while Kashyap  was scared about Mahur. It
                was all happening again. Professor is lost. His  favourite student had
                joined him in the investigation. They were starting to  get fond of each
                other. What next? Death again? Kashyap stopped talking and  stood up. He
                told Madhur that he was going for a walk on the train. Madhur was  confused.
                “On the train?” Before he could have asked any further questions,  Kashyap
                was gone. Madhur started looking out of the window again. The greenery
                immersed him inside it. He switched to sightseeing with the book from time
                to  time. Madhur got up and went looking for Kashyap. He didn’t find him. He
                gave  up and came back to seat to find that an old man was in his seat. He
                asked him  to leave but the old man didn’t listen. Madhur was already
                frustrated about  Kashyap leaving him like this. He yelled at the old man
                and it fixed him. The  old man got up, cussed him and left. Mahur sat on his
                seat in anger and looked  outside the window. He was not looking at the
                greenery anymore. His mind was  thinking about Kashyap.
            </p>
            <p>
                The  first station arrived. Madhur got down the train and bought some
                biscuits and  tea for snacks. A boy, of around the same age as that of
                Madhur joined him in  the chit chat. Madhur didn’t reveal anything about
                Kashyap. They talked about  the weather. Madhur told him that he was headed
                to Darjeeling to meet his  grandparents. The boy told him that the next stop
                was his. They talked more.  Both got into the train together and Madhur let
                the boy sit on Kashyap’s chair.  On the next stop the boy got off the train.
                Madhur helped him with the luggage.  After a while Madhur realised that the
                guy was a pickpocketer and his wallet  was stolen, along with 800 rupees and
                Sheena’s earring that he kept with him  every time. He was pissed off. There
                was no way he could get that back. He  blamed and cussed Kashyap for that.
                If he hadn’t left like that, nothing would  have happened.
            </p>
            <p>
                After a long while when Madhur was asleep,  Kashyap returned and sat on his
                seat. He prayed that Mahur wouldn't wake up. He  didn’t. The journey to
                Darjeeling was completed.
            </p>
            <h2>Who Killed  Dibakar</h2>
            <p>
                When Madhur woke up he saw Kashyap sitting  by his legs. Looking out of the
                window. Madhur quickly got up.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Why did you run away, Kashyap?”  Infuriated.
            </p>
            <p>
                “I didn’t run away Mahur, I went to–”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Don’t you make any excuse, you idiot! I  lost my wallet because of you.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Manners, Madhur. I have money Madhur, take  it.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “I’ll shove those manners in your throat.  That’s the only way to keep your
                mouth away from making excuses .It’s not just  the money. The wallet had
                Sheena’s earring in it.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Kashyap went quiet. The stop arrived and  Kashyap grabbed the opportunity to
                save himself. He broke eye contact and  quickly got off the train. Madhur
                was angry but there was no way Kashyap could  correct this situation. He
                decided to ignore it. They exited the station and  the
                <em>
                    Rickshaw-walas
                </em>
                were ready at the  gate to pick up passengers. Kashyap and Madhur didn’t
                know where to go. They  decided to have a cup of tea at the nearby
                <em>
                    tapri.
                </em>
                While sipping the tea Kashyap asked, “Do you have any idea for our further
                steps?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Weren’t you planning the next move on the  train?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Well the plan was to ask you more about  Roy’s behaviour but you were not
                in the right state of mind to think straight.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Who should we thank for that?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “I know I made a mistake. Can you not pull  out your drama here now?”
            </p>
            <p>
                Madhur sipped some tea and something  clicked in his mind. He kept the cup
                on the table and ran towards the Rickshaw.  “Oh shit! Let’s go detective!”
            </p>
            <p>
                Kashyap followed him.
            </p>
            <p>
                Madhur told the <em>Rickshaw-wala</em>to take the Rickshaw to Darjeeling’s
                theatre.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Once, during the lecture, Roy sir recited  ‘to be or not to be’ for the
                class. It was perfect. There is no way a simple  writer or a teacher can
                match that perfection. It has to be done by an actor. I  am sure Roy sir
                worked in a theatre.”
            </p>
            <p>
                The rickshaw headed to the most popular  theatre in Darjeeling. Madhur paid
                the guy with Kashyap’s money and they both  entered the theatre. Othello was
                being acted. They waited for the play to end  for half an hour. Soon they
                asked the manager if she had any data of the groups  that performed there.
                Surprisingly the theatre kept a record of all the groups  that had ever
                performed there. They looked through the old 5 kg binders one by  one. To
                find the name they had been brainstorming for. Nikhil Roy. After an hour  of
                checking through the numerous books they found the name under the theatre
                group, Theatre Of Students. They asked the manager for the information about
                that group. The manager told him that she had not been a part of the theatre
                for that long time. She told them that they must ask for it to his father.
                She  called her father, now the owner of the theatre. He arrived there in a
                wheelchair. They asked him about the group. Very joyfully the old man
                answered.  “Oh! This group stopped performing a long time ago. You must be
                close friends  with them.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Yes sir we are, we are looking for this  man here, Nikhil Roy!”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Ohh the writer! Sweet child. He was one of  my tenants a long time ago.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Apparently. Kumar ji had bought the theatre  with his money to fill the hole
                in his life after his daughter went off to  college. He used to keep
                watching the plays all day long. His daughter was the  working manager now,
                in the same theatre.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Do you know him personally?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Yes I do. He never paid the rent on time.  That silly writer made millions
                after he left.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Can you tell us where he used to live?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “I sold that building long ago. It’s a 15  minute ride from here.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Kumar Ji told them the address and they got  in a rickshaw in no time. The
                rickshaw arrived at the building and Kashyap  rushed through the stairs
                without paying. Madhur stood at the rickshaw counting  the leftover rupees.
                Kashyap was at the door when a kid called him and said
            </p>
            <p>
                “Your friend told me to get you down and  bring 15 rupees for the rickshaw.”
                Kashyap was terrified. It was happening  again. The flashes of Mishti
                dropping dead on the street got to him. He didn’t  knock. He stood by the
                door, frozen. The kid tapped his back once. He snapped  out of the frozen
                state and rushed down the stairs. Sweating off of his  clothes. The panic
                was felt by each and every cell in his body. His heart rate  spiked. He
                reached the bottom of the building and dashed Madhur on the ground.  His
                heart was pounding. He looked at Madhir, then the
                <em>Rickshaw-wala.</em>Nothing had happened. Madhur was safe. Everything
                was fine. Madhur asked him for the explanation of what he just did. He told
                Mahur that he will do it later. Madhur took the money from Kashyap and paid
                the <em>Rickshaw-wala</em>. He asked Kashyap if he  had any plans of getting
                up from the ground any time soon. Kashyap told him to  carry on and he would
                join him shortly. Madhur did. He knocked at the door and  the man who opened
                the door was his teacher, Nikhil Roy. But he was not the Roy  Madhur and the
                other students had seen. He was in his bermuda and undershirt.  He had a
                wide smile on his face.
            </p>
            <p>
                “So you cracked the code Know-it-all.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Yes sir we did!”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Did you like Kashyap?”
            </p>
            <p>
                "To be honest sir, He is a nuisance.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Hahh! He is meant to be. Come in.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Madhur entered the room and sat on a chair.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Who was the kidnapper sir? Who kidnapped  Dibakar?”
            </p>
            <p>
                Nikhil was pouring tea for Madhur when he  asked that question. He abruptly
                stopped. You didn’t find it? Why are you here  then?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Me and Kashyap are here to ask you for the  answer. Weren’t we supposed
                to?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Kashyap is still here? In our world?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Yes sir, he will be here shortly.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Nikhil froze. “Ohhh no! NO! No!!!! What  have you done Madhur!”
            </p>
            <p>
                “He was helping me to find you sir.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “No you idiot! He is here to kill me!”
            </p>
            <p>
                “What!! No sir you must have misunderstood  Kashy—”
            </p>
            <p>
                Kashyap slammed the door open and took out  the gun that he pointed at
                Sheena, Only this time he actually pulled the  trigger. BAM! The bullet went
                straight through Nikhil’s head. He fell dead on  the ground. Madhur screamed
                in terror. Nikhil was smiling. The smirk threatened  Madhur. He hid in the
                bedroom. Kashyap assured him that he won;t harm Madhur  but he had no
                intentions of believing him. He yelled from the room, “Why did  you do
                that?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Why!! You are asking me this? This man  took every good thing in my life
                away from me. I was the chief of police. He  got me suspended from the
                force. That’s why I became a detective. It was my  only option. I had the
                perfect life of an officer. Big crimes, Gangster, Mafia,  Murders and
                everything. I solved many cases Madhur. But he didn’t want me to be  happy.
                He wrote that while working on a case I shot every suspect down. It was  the
                only way to catch the criminal. I crossed the limits. I know I did. But this
                man didn’t even have the mercy to write that one of those suspects was the
                criminal. He wrote down each one of them as not guilty. I was suspended. I
                don’t care about being suspended Madhur. It was the only case I failed in.”
                He  took a long pause.
            </p>
            <p>
                Madhur was breathing heavily, “You—You  killed him for that?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “I am not so stupid Madhur. There’s one  more reason. After being suspended
                I didn’t get any interesting cases.  Everything was easy. House robbery,
                pick pocketing and other petty crimes.  Finally after years Mishti came into
                my life with an interesting case. The case  was perfect. Just what I wanted.
                No complaints about the case but this  merciless man here took Mishti away
                from me. She was the only one who cared  about me Madhur, she was the only
                one who I cared about. A man like me, finally  had the intention to care
                about another person. He took that away from me  Madhur! He took it away
                from me!”
            </p>
            <p>
                “You are a psychopath!”
            </p>
            <p>
                “I know. I am. Now you have a task to  fulfil, kid. Listen to me. Soon I
                will be gone. I need you to complete the  story for me. If Roy is right, you
                know the criminal. Roy would want that too.  That’s why he handed you the
                task. I know I manipulated you for my use. But he  wanted you to know about
                the criminal and complete the story. Do it kid.”
            </p>
            <p>
                The police arrived and arrested Kashyap on  the spot. They rescued Madhur
                and told him not to leave the city. Madhur was  not going to stay. He
                decided to deny the request of the officer. He left the  city as soon as
                possible. Kashyap was in jail. A day after the murder, when  Kashyap knew
                Madhur was out of danger of getting arrested, he decided to leave.  Everyone
                thought that it was a jailbreak. But there was no evidence. The
                investigation took place. A week went, two, three. Everyone assumed that
                Kashyap had broken out of jail. But in reality, he went back into the pages.

                Mahur  came back from the trip and told everything to Sheena. She was
                heartbroken.  While crying on Madhur’s bed, she asked him if he knew about
                the kidnapper. He  told her that it was not a kidnapping. Nikhil somehow
                managed to convince him  that Dibakar was murdered.
            </p>
            <p>
                “By whom?” She asked.
            </p>
            <p>
                Madhur took a deep breath. “I am a hundred  percent sure of this Sheena. It
                was his wife.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Wife? How? Did Roy sir tell you?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Yes and no!”
            </p>
            <p>
                “What do you mean Madhur, don’t play games  with me now.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “He told about the killer. But not just to  me. He told us about her in the
                lecture.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Another easter egg? Tell me.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “I was thinking about it on the way home.  Do you remember the Shakespear
                lecture? In that he said that when we grow up,  we will understand the
                meaning of betrayal. And I specifically remember him  saying when we will be
                betrayed by your friend, uncle, perhaps wife. This  statement pricked me a
                bit. None of the Shakespear’s plays say that any wife  ever betrayed her
                husband. This is not a mistake that Roy sir or any other  Shakespear devotee
                would ever make. And while saying it, he emphasised on  ‘wife’. It has to be
                the wife Sheena. I know for sure.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Sheena was impressed. She smiled at him.
            </p>
            <p>
                “That’s great Madhu! Go on, write it down  now. That’s what Nikhil sir
                wanted.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “No Sheena. I won’t. I can’t let that  bastard Kashyap win. I won’t write
                it. He must live in agony.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “But what about Nikhil sir? You won’t  finish the story he started?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “I will.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Madhur ended the story with, ‘And Kashyap  never found out the culprit!’
